)
and
the
Korea

)
announced
that
Danuri
,
Korea
's
first
lunar
orbiter
,
was
successfully
placed
in
lunar
orbit
at
6:00
p.m.
December
27
.
After
carrying
out
the
third
and
last
lunar
orbit
insertion
(
LOI
)
maneuver
*
on
December
26
,
Danuri
successfully
reached
its
target
orbit
*
*
and
is
revolving
around
the
moon
every
two
hours
at
a
speed
of
1.62km
/
s.
Every
machine
and
devices
on
Danuri
,
also
known
as
the
Korea
Pathfinder
Lunar
Orbiter
(
KPLO
)
,
are
working
fine
,
including
the
onboard
computer
and
flight
-
control
sensors
.
It
has
93
kg
of
fuel
left
from
its
full
tank
of
260
kg
,
enough
to
serve
its
yearlong
mission
throughout
2023
.
Lunar

)
maneuver
:
An
adjustment
process
for
a
space
vehicle
(
Danuri
)
to
lower
its
speed
using
thrusters
and
commit
itself
to
the
gravity
of
the
Moon
.
The
target
orbit
of
Danuri
's
mission
is
100
km
±
30
km
above
the
moon
.
Danuri
successfully
entering
lunar
orbit
is
meaning
as
it
proved
that
Korea
has
secured
space
exploration
capabilities
,
and
can
indigenously
build
a
lunar
orbiter
that
can
actually
reach
the
moon
.
This
has
layed
the
groundwork
for
future
space
exploration
and
development
of
a
lunar
lander
.
Next
year
,
Danuri
will
shift
its
position
so
that
its
payload
faces
the
lunar
surface
for
a
yearlong
exploration
of
the
surface
.
Until
the
end
of
January
2023
,
Danuri
will
be
checking
the
payload
functions
and
correcting
errors
and
distortions
.
From
February
2023
,
lunar
scientific
missions
(
generate
polarized
images
of
the
lunar
surface
,
take
magnetic
field
and
radiation
measurements
)
will
be
conducted
along
with
testing
space
internet
technology
.
The
images
of
lunar
surface
captured
by
a
high
-
resolution
camera
,
in
particular
,
will
be
used
to
support
landing
site
selection
for
future
mission
planned
for
2032
.
First

said
,
"
Korea
made
history
as
the
seventh
country
in
the
world
to
explore
the

.
In
the
next
10

,
we
will
keep
strengthening
the

thus
becoming
an
important
factor
in
the

This
is
why
an
asteroid

is
considered
to
be
a
key
for
studying
the
orbital

of
the
Solar

The
existence
of
water
on
the
Moon
is
of
utmost
importance
not
only
for
lunar
science
but
also
for
ISRU
(

.
The
Lunar
Infrared
Spectrometer
is
currently
being
developed
for
Korean
lunar
orbiter
to
investigate
traces
of
water
that
may
exist
in
low
temperature
regions
,
especially
in
highlands
to
reconstruct
a
water
distribution
map
of
the
Moon
.
We
expect
to
discover
how
water
circulates
in
different
lunar
environments
and
how
lunar
surface
material
evolves
accordingly
.
Study

such
as
the

We
also
study
the

and
the

based
on

.
Currently
,
we
are
building

we
found
that
the

have
been
changed
considerably
by
the
non

as
the

From
the
changes

Cosmology
Cosmology
is
in
its
golden
age
and
is
expected
to
be
a
growing
field
of
science
in
the
next
couple
of
decades
,
considering
the
variety
of
surveys
currently
active
and
the
long
list
of
surveys
funded
and
planned
for
observation
of
the
universe
at
different
wavelengths
,
scales
,
and
depths
in
the
near

.
The
fact
that
two
Nobel
prizes
in
physics
(
in
2006
and
2011
)
were
awarded
for
work
in
cosmology
in
less
than
a
decade
probably
reflects
the
current
importance
of
cosmology
.
While
there
have
been
many
developments
in
cosmology
,
many
puzzles
remain
to
be
solved
.
The
nature
of
dark
energy
and
dark
matter
,
which
together
constitute
more
than
95
%
of
the
energy
budget
of
the
universe
,
are
totally
unknown
.
The
initial
conditions
of
the
universe
are
also
unknown
,
and
we
are
not
yet
confident
of
the
mechanisms
and
theories
that
explain
how
the
universe
began
.
To
study
the
universe
and
more
closely
examine
these
mysterious
components
of
nature
,
there
have
been
extensive
efforts
to
build
bigger
and
more
advanced
telescopes
functioning
at
different
wavelengths
to
probe
the
universe
.
Soon
we
will
have
the
fourth

,
considering
its
vibrant
environment
,
strong
infrastructure
,
and
rich
human
resources
,
as
well
as
its
modern
technical
and
observational
facilities
and
instrumentation
,
would
certainly
allow
us
to
participate
as
a
pioneer
in
this
international
effort
to
understand
the
universe
.
KASI
clearly
has
the
potential
to
be
involved
in
most
major
international
collaborations
(
as
it
is
already
;
for
example
,
KASI
is
very
much
involved
with
GMT
and
DESI
)
and
is
also
active
on
all
fronts
,
from
instrumentation
design
and
fabrication
to
observation
and
also
data
analysis
and
high
-
level
theoretical
work
.
Korea
is
certainly
moving
in
this
direction
,
but
there
is
still
some
work
to
do
to
catch
up
with
other
countries
,
because
the
field
does
not
stand
still
,
huge
efforts
and
appropriate
planning
are
necessary
to
achieve
excellence
in
science
and
realize
great
results
.
Our
strategic
goal
is
to
participate
in
this
quest
to
obtain
for
Korea
a
larger
share
in
global
science
production
and
major
discoveries
in
astronomy
and
astrophysics
.
KASI
is
playing
a
crucial
role
in
this
direction
,
and
we
hope
we
can
help
it
to
perform
its
weighty
and
important
duties
.
In
our
proposal
,
we
aim
to
become
a
leading
center
in
cosmology
at
the
international
level
,
to
grow
in
various
directions
,
and
to
prepare
the
environment
for
Korea
to
become
a
pioneer
country
worldwide
in
the
field
of
cosmology
.
The
cosmology
group
at
KASI
(
CosKASI
)
has
joined
DESI
.
The
primary
science
goal
of
the
DESI
experiment
is
to
clarify
the
nature
of
dark
energy
and/or
gravity
through
the
baryon
acoustic
oscillation
and
redshift
-
space
distortion
effects
.
Starting
in
2018
,
it
will
obtain
optical
spectra
for
tens
of
millions
of
galaxies
and
quasars
,
constructing
a
three
-
dimensional
map
spanning
the
nearby
universe
out
to
10
billion
light
years
.
DESI
observations
will
be
conducted
on
the
Mayall

-
m
telescope
at
Kitt
Peak
National
Observatory
.
The
observatory
is
supported
by
the
Department
of
Energy
’s
Office
of
Science
to
perform
this
Stage
IV
dark
energy
measurement
.
Two
members
of
CosKASI
have
participated
in
DESI
since
2014
and
collaborate
on
galaxy
clustering
and
time
streaming
physics
.
CosKASI
plans
to
sign
a
memorandum
of
agreement
with
the
LSST
in
2015
.
The
LSST
is
a
wide
-
field
survey
reflecting
telescope
that
will
photograph
the
entire
available
sky
every
few
nights
.
It
is
currently
in
the
design
and
mirror

,
and

.
CosKASI
members
have
joined
the
dark
energy
working
group
.
DESI
is
the
premier
spectroscopic
galaxy
survey
,
and
LSST
is
the
premier
imaging
galaxy
survey
.
The
cross
-
correlation
of
both
maps
will
resolve
the
systematics
in
each
survey
to
enhance
cosmological
constraints
and
provide
a
unique
window
to
test
Einstein
's
gravity
at
the
cosmological
scale
.
In
addition
,
both
will
guide
the
followup
observations
by
the
GMT
as
pathfinders
to
suitable
targets
.
With
the
facilities
available
at
CosKASI
,
we
will
investigate
key
issues
of
the
standard
model
of
the
Universe
and
to
test
fundamental
physics
at
cosmological
scales
.
Initial
conditions
of
the
universe
beyond
slow
-
roll
single
-
field
inflation
:
Although
the
assumed
scale
-
invariant
initial
power
spectra
may
be
a
generic
prediction
of
the
simplest
scenarios
of
the
generation
of
perturbations
during
inflation
,
initial
spectra
with
radical
deviations
are
known
to
arise
from
very
reasonable
extensions
or
refinements
of
the
simplest
scenarios
.
Consequently
,
cosmological
parameter
estimation
from
the
cosmic
microwave
background
(
CMB
)
anisotropy
and
the
matter
power
spectrum
obtained
from
redshift
surveys
,
weak
gravitational
lensing
,
and
Ly
-
α
absorption
depends
sensitively
on
the
dimensionality
,
nature
,
and
freedom
in
parameter
space
of
the
initial
conditions
.
Understanding
the
initial
conditions
of
the
universe
and
the
form
of
the
primordial
spectrum
is
a
key
issue
in
modern
cosmology
that
can
pave
the
way
to
understanding
how
our
universe
began
.
Measuring
non
-
Gaussianity
in
the
CMB
fluctuations
can
add
another
dimension
to
studies
of
the
early
universe
,
as
we
can
break
the
degeneracies
between
single
field
inflationary
models
and
scenarios
considering
more
than
a
single
field
.
Dark
matter
:
Beyond
the
invisibility
of
darkness
Since
Zwicky
speculated
that
the
Coma
Cluster
might
contain
a
large
amount
of
dark
matter
in
the
1930s
,
the
puzzle
of
its
nature
has
become
one
of
the
foremost
unresolved
questions
of
particle
physics
and
cosmology
.
The
existence
of
dark
matter
can
simply
explain
various
phenomena
involved
in
astrophysical
and
cosmological
problems
at
different
scales
.
As
more
dark
matter
properties
have
been
discovered
,
it
is
no
longer
dark
.
CMB
experiments
yielded
the
precise
relic
density
of
dark
matter
,
and
the
Bullet
Cluster
constrained
the
size
of
its
self
-
interaction
.
The
warmness
of
dark
matter
is
further
examined
by
the
formation
of
small
-
scale
structure
such
as
the
Ly
-
α
forest
.
Complementary
experiments
involving
direct
and
indirect
detection
of
dark
matter
and
collider
experiments
are
also
used
to
determine
the
visibility
of
dark
matter
.
Dark
energy
versus
modified
gravity
:
Beyond
Einstein
’s
gravity
The
discovery
of
cosmic
acceleration
decades
ago~\cite{cosmic_acceleration
}
has
forced
cosmologists
to
modify
their
simple
picture
of
the
universe
,
i.e.
,
a
universe
dominated
only
by
matter
and
described
solely
by
general
relativity
.
Over
the
last
10
years
,
physicists
have
suggested
two
main
avenues
for
explaining
the
late
-
time
acceleration
of
the
universe
.
The
first
is
the
introduction
of
dark
energy
,
with
an
effective
negative
pressure
,
which
dominates
the
late
-
time
energy
density
of
the
universe
,
thus
causing
the
acceleration
.
An
alternative
explanation
is
a
modification
of
the
law
of
gravity
on
large
scales
,
which
alters
the
predicted
expansion
history
of
the
universe
to
be
in
line
with
the
observations
.
With
the
level
of
precision
available
in
future
surveys
,
we
can
use
the
high
-
resolution
maps
yielded
by
next
-
generation
surveys
to
test
the
foundations
of
gravity
and
particle
physics
.
The
premier
spectroscopic
survey
,
DESI
,
will
provide
information
about
the
dynamic
potential
,
and
the
premier
imaging
survey
,
LSST
,
will
provide
information
about
the
lensing
potential
.
CosKASI
has
a
privileged
position
for
testing
the
fundamental
knowledge
of
gravity
using
both
of
these
precise
maps
in
the
near
future
.

as
lunar
exploration
in
the
New
Space
era
marked
by
a
challenging
mindset
,
innovation
,
and
new
opportunities
as
of
late
.
Developed
countries
in
aerospace
are
recognizing
the
Moon
as
an
area
of
undeveloped
and
unlimited
potential
,
unlike
the
lunar
exploration
of
the
past
,
and
are
in
the
process
of
being
at
the
forefront
of
space
development
through
lunar
exploration
.
Developed
countries
in
aerospace
are
transitioning
their
space
development
sights
from
a
focus
on
Earth
to
the
Moon
and
Mars
based
on
developed
space
technologies
,
and
are
securing
more
advanced
space
technologies
through
space
exploration
.
The
U.S.
has
held
its
status
as
a
leading
country
in
space
development
through
space
exploration
and
maintains
a
strong
interest
in
the
field
of
science
,
national
security
,
and
economy
.
Our
regional
neighbors
such
as
Japan
,
China
,
and
India
are
also
actively
progressing
forward
in
the
exploration
of
the
Moon
,
comets
,
and
Mars
.
Through
lunar
exploration
,
they
are
seeking
the
development
of
high
-
tech
space
technologies
such
as
flight
and
control
technology
to
the
Moon
,
technology
to
enter
lunar

-
Earth
technology
,
lunar
exploration
rover
operation
in
an
extreme

,
nuclear
batteries
,
and
space
Internet
.
The
reason
why
the
world
’s
sights
are
on
the
Moon
once
again
is
that
they
can
secure
natural
resources
from
the
Moon
along
with
the
possibility
of
utilizing
the
satellite
as
a
stopover
site
for
the
deep
space
exploration
of
Mars
,
etc
.
With
manned
and
unmanned
explorations
,
the
presence
of
rare
resources
like
water
,
Helium
3(He3
)
,
Uranium
,
and
rare
earth
elements
on
the
Moon
have
been
confirmed
.
As
of
now
,
the
only
countries
which
have
succeeded
in
unmanned
lunar
landings
are
the
U.S.
,
the
former
Soviet
Union
,
and
China
,
and
the
six
countries
or

which
have
succeeded
in

include
Japan
,
China
,
India
,
the
EU

Technologies
required
for
Lunar
Orbit
Exploration
The
test
lunar
orbiter
(
KPLO
)
is
scheduled
for
launch
on
board
the
U.S.
SpaceX
’s
Falcon
9
launch
vehicle
in
August
2022
.
After
its
launch
,
the
test
lunar
orbiter
(
KPLO
)
will
shoot
toward
the
Moon
using
the
lunar
orbit
transfer
method
(
BLT
/
WSB
)
,
which
approaches
lunar
orbit
by
using
the
nearby
astrophysical
gravity
of
the
Sun
and
Earth
.
The
launch
of
the
test
lunar
orbiter
(
KPLO
)
was
originally
scheduled
in
December
2020
but
was
postponed
to
August
2022
.
KPLO
’s
Lunar
Entry
Orbit
Going
to
the
Moon
with
BLT
/

method
The
orbit
for
going
to
the
Moon
broadly
consists
of
Direct
Transfer
,
3.5
Phasing
Loop
Transfer
,
BLT
(
Ballastic
Lunar
Transfer
)
,
etc
.
The
Direct
Transfer
method
previously
used
by
the
Apollo
program
requires
time
within
about
5
days
.
The
3.5
Phasing
Loop
Transfer
used
by
India
’s
Chandrayaan
program
is
a
method
of
entering
lunar
orbit
after
revolving
several
times
around
the
Earth
in
a
long
elliptical
orbit
.
BLT
/
WSB
method
entails
flying
to
the
L1
Lagrangian
point
between
the
Earth
and
Sun
,
which
was
designed
to
minimize
the
space
probe
’s
fuel
consumption
.
After
launch
,
KPLO
was
separated
from
the
launch
vehicle
after
entering
the
Transfer
Orbit
,
an
elliptical
orbit
.
Subsequently
,
after
making
the
solar
panels
face
the
Sun
,
the
solar
panels
were
fully
deployed
by
automation
.
Then
,
the
process
of
raising
its
orbit
by
liquid
apogee
engine
(
LAE
)
firing
occurred
in
order
to
enter
the
drift
orbit
from
transfer
orbit
.
Once
the
satellite
got
into
position
,
the
engine
fires
a
total
of
5
times
and
ascends
into
a
circular
orbit
(
drift
orbit
)
from
an
elliptical
one
.
And
then
,
by
using
orbit
information
and
the
satellite
-
installed
star
sensor
,
it
acquired
its
position
facing
the
Earth
,
and
finally
reaches
satellite
mission
altitude

→
7,500
km
/
h
)
and
entered
into
the
elliptical
orbit
,
stably
captured
by
the
Moon
’s
gravity
.
Four
more
LOI
maneuvers
(

”
,
the
images
presented
this
time
captured
the
“
process
”
of
the
moon
’s
revolution
.
The
KPLO
Gamma
Ray
Spectrometer
(
KGRS
)
successfully
observed
the

generated
by
the
black
hole
.
The
gamma
ray
explosion
was
also
observed
in
the
U.S.
and
Europe
.
It
was
a
substantial
observation
in
a
sense
that
it
was
the
first
observed
gamma

range
,
indicating
that
Danuri
was
operating
normally
.
As
Danuri
is
on
a
low
-
power
,
fuel
-
efficient
ballistic
lunar
transfer
trajectory
,
it
will
initially
set
off
on
a
trajectory
heading
towards
the
L1
Lagrangian
point
,
where
the
gravitational
forces
of
the
Earth
and
the
Moon
are
balanced
.
Then
,
on
September
2
,
Danuri
will
conduct
Trajectory
Correction
Maneuver
(
TCM
)
,
adjusting
the
orbiter
’s
cruising
direction
,
position
and
speed

.
KARI
initially
planned
to
confirm
the
final
TCM
outcome
at
17:00
September
4
,
after
about
48
hours
of
trajectory
information
assessment
,
but
the
actual
confirmation
time
was
18:00

)
set
June
15
,
2022
as
the
second

date
for
KSLV
-
II
,
also
known
as
Nuri
,
with
reserved
launch
dates
between
June
16
and
23
.
The
launch
date
was
designated
by
the
Launch
Management
Committee
,
a
decision
-
making
body
for
Nuri
launch
,
after
a
comprehensive
review
on
technical
preparedness
and
various
launch
conditions
such
as
weather
conditions
,
space
environment
,
and
possibilities
of
collisions
between
space
objects
.
A
performance
verification
satellite
will
be
loaded
this
time
onto
the
space
vehicle
and
a
comprehensive
drill
was
conducted
on
May
19
against
possible
contingencies
and
to
ensure
public
safety
on
the
launch
date
.
First
Vice
Minister
Oh

have
made
full
-
fledged
efforts
to
identify
and
make
technical
improvement
since
the
first
launch
of
Nuri
.
Now
that
I
visit
the
Naro
Space
Center
,
looking
around
the
launch
site
and
reported
of
the
performance
verification
satellite
inspection
results
,
I
can
feel
their
hard
work
more
than
ever.&quot
;
"
As
we
are
loading
the
performance
verification
satellite
onto
Nuri
this
time
,
which
is
a
first
trial
to
lift
off
our
own
satellite
independently
,
the
government
will
also
provide
an
unwavering
support
to
the
end

Korea
Successfully
Launches
Homegrown
Rocket
Nuri
The
Ministry
of
Science
and
ICT
(
MSIT
,
Minister
Lee
Jong
-
ho
)
and
the
Korea
Aerospace
Research
Agency
(
KARI
,
President
Lee
Sang
-
Yul
)
announced
that
the
second
launch
of
the
homegrown
space
launch
vehicle
Nuri
(
Korea
Space
Launch
Vehicle
-
II
,
KSLV
-
II
)
,
developed
in
order
to
secure
Korea
’s
space
transportation
capability
,
was
successful
,
thanks
to
people
’s
interest
and
support
.
After
the
Nuri
rocket
,
which
was
launched
at
16:00
,
finished
its
flight
,
KARI
carried
out
an
early
analysis
of
the
telemetry
data
sent
from
Nuri
and
confirmed
that
Nuri
successfully
separated
and
put
the
performance
verification
satellite
into
the
targeted
orbit
.
After
the
launch
,
the
flight
of
Nuri
progressed
normally
in
accordance
with
the
set
flight
sequence
.
The
first
,
second
and
third
stage
engines
of
Nuri
all
burned
out
as
planned
and
the
fairing
separation
was
also
successful
,
making
the
separation
of
the
performance
verification
satellite
successful
as
well
.
The
location
of
the
performance
verification
satellite
was
confirmed
after
it
made
communication
with
the
King
Sejong
Station
in
Antarctica
;
two
-
way
communication
with
KARI
ground
station
will
be
conducted
starting
3:00
a.m.
the
next
day
to
check
the
satellite
’s
state
.
The
success
of
Nuri
is
meaningful
in
that
it
shows
Korea
has
secured
its
own
capacity
for
independent
space
transportation
and
space
development
.
This
launch
has
completed
the
development
of
Nuri
,
and
four
more
test
launches
will
be
made
by
2027
to
improve
the
launch
vehicle
’s
reliability
.
Minister
Lee
Jong
-
ho
of
Science
and
ICT
said
,
“
Building
on
the
experience
and
technologies
of
Nuri
development
,
the
government
will
promote
the
development
of
more
advanced
space
launch
vehicles
to
improve
Korea
’s
capabilities
to
launch
satellites
.
”
He
continued
,
“
I
would
like
to
express
my
heartfelt
gratitude
to
the
Korean

The
Idea
that
We
Ca
n’t
Launch
a
Satellite
When
Everyone
Else
Is
Doing
It
Is
Shameless
”
On
June
1
,
Kim
Yo
-
jong
,
deputy
director
of
the
Workers
’
Party
of
Korea
and
the
younger
sister
of
North
Korean
leader
Kim
Jong
-
un
,
condemned
the
United
States
and
said
,
“
Insisting
on
the
irrational
idea
that
we
alone
can
not
launch
a
satellite
--
something
everyone
else
is
doing
--
using
the
UN
Security
Council
resolution
banning
the
use
of
ballistic
rocket
technology
for
any
purpose
as
an
excuse
is
a
serious
violation
and
unfair
suppression
of
our
country
’s
right
to
use
space
.
It
is
clearly
shameless
and
wrong
.
”
Deputy
Director
Kim
made
the
argument
in
a
statement
titled
,
“
No
One
Can
Deny
Our
Sovereign
Right
to
Launch
a
Satellite
,
”
released
by
the
Korean
Central
News
Agency
Thursday
,
claiming
,
“
The
United
States
blatantly
revealed
its
inherent
hostility
against
our
republic
by
raising
an
issue
with
the
launch
of
a
military
reconnaissance
satellite
,
which
is
an
exercise
of
the
right
to
self
-
defense
of
the
Democratic
People
’s
Republic
of
Korea
(
DPRK
)
.
”
North
Korea
censured
the
U.S.
White
House
,
which
denounced
the
North
’s
failed
launch
of
Chollima-1
,
a
rocket
loaded
with
the
military
reconnaissance
satellite
Malligyong-1
,
for
violating
a
UN
Security
Council
resolution
.
The
North
tried
to
justify
the
latest
launch
as
an
exercise
of
its
right
to
self
-
defense
.
Kim
Yo
-
jong
argued
that
the
U.S.
was
applying
double
standards
when
it
came
to
the
satellite
launch
.
She
said
,
“
If
our
satellite
launch
must
be
condemned
,
then
the
countries
that
have
already
launched
thousands
of
satellites
should
all
be
condemned
starting
with
the
U.S.
It
is
nothing
other
than
a
fallacious
and
self
-
contradicting
argument
.
”
She
further
argued
,
“
This
country
called
the
United
States
is
a
gang
of
robbers
that
would
cry
that
it
’s
illegal
and
a
threat
even
if
we
sent
a
satellite
into
orbit
tied
to
a
balloon
.
”
The
deputy
director
of
the
Workers
’
Party
of
Korea
continued
her
fierce
criticism
of
the
U.S.
She
said
,
“
The
U.S.
has
packed
the
airspace
above
the
Korean
Peninsula
with
all
kinds
of
spy
assets
,
such
as
reconnaissance
satellites
and
high
-
altitude
unmanned
surveillance
vehicles
,
and
is
even
at
this
minute
busy
anxiously
monitoring
our
every
actions
.
Such
a
country
raising
an
issue
with
our
launch
of
a
military
reconnaissance
satellite
is
truly
shameless
and
unreasonable
.
”
The
DPRK
released
two
pictures
of
the
launch
of
the
rocket
carrying
a
military
spy
satellite
from
the
previous
day
along
with
Deputy
Director
Kim
Yo
-
jong
’s
statement
.
They
showed
a
rocket
soaring
into
the
air
amid
flames
and
nearby
facilities
from
a
location
believed
to
be
the
new
launch
site
,
quickly
set
up
in
the
Sohae
Satellite
Launching
Station
in
Tongchang
-
ri
,
Cholsan
County
in
North
Pyongan
Province
.
The
pictures
hinted
at
an
intention
to
ensure
credibility
by
clearing
up
any
suspicions
about
the
satellite
launch
.
The
North
Korean
leader
’s
younger
sister
reaffirmed
the
North
’s
determination
to
make
another
attempt
to
send
its
first
military
spy
satellite
into
orbit
.
She
said
,
“
I
can
definitely
say
that
a
military
reconnaissance
satellite
of
the
Democratic
People
’s
Republic
of
Korea
will
accurately
enter
into
orbit
and
conduct
its
mission
in
the
near
future
.
”
The
previous
day
,
the
National
Aerospace
Development
Administration
of
the
DPRK
announced
that
they
would
attempt
another
launch
soon
after
conducting
tests
in
several
areas
.
Kim
Yo
-
jong
said
,
“
Reading
the
minds
of
the
U.S.
and
its
followers
,
so
nervous
at
our
military
reconnaissance
satellite
,
we
reaffirmed
that
the
enemies
most
feared
our
possession
of
excellent
reconnaissance
and
intelligence
means
including
the
spy
satellite
,
”
and
concluded
,
“
Therefore
,
we
think
that
we
should
put
in
a
much
larger
effort
into
developing
reconnaissance
methods
.
”
Once
again
,
Deputy
Director
Kim
said
that
North
Korea
would
not
engage
in
dialogue
with
the
U.S.
and
South
Korea
.
“
Again
,
we
would
like
to
clearly
warn
the
U.S.
,
which
is
taking
advantage
of
this
opportunity
and
trying
to
blur
the
eyes
and
ears
of
the
international
society
with
appealing
mention
of
dialogue
,
such
as
a
‘
door
to
diplomacy
’
or
a
‘
serious
negotiation
,
’
”
she
said
,
and
argued
,
“
We
have
nothing
to
discuss
with
and
feel
no
need
for
dialogue
with
the
U.S.
and
its
pawns
that
have
a
habit
of
chattering
about
the
‘
end
of
regime
,
’
and
‘
overthrowing
the
system
.
’
”
In
a
summit
between
U.S.
President
Joe
Biden
and
President
Yoon
Suk
-
yeol
in
April
,
the
two
leaders
reaffirmed
their
determination
to
engage
in
diplomacy
with
North
Korea
as
the
only
means
to
achieve
sustainable
peace
on
the
Korean
Peninsula
and
urged
Pyongyang
to
return
to
the
negotiation
table
.
They
announced
that
they
would
firmly
promote
diplomacy
and
no
-
strings
-
attached
dialogue
with
North
Korea
to
make
progress
toward
the
common
goal
--
the
complete
denuclearization
of
the
Korean
Peninsula
.
President
Biden
also
mentioned
the
“
end
of
regime
”
if
North
Korea
engaged
in
a
nuclear
attack
.
Kim
Yo
-
jong
said
,
“
We
will
continue
to
respond
in
our
own
way
in
a
more
aggressive
attitude
to
make
it
inevitable
for
them
to
acknowledge
how
dangerous
it
is
to
continue
to
confront
us
,
”
and
added
,
“
We
are
prepared
to
do
anything
it
takes
to
defend
our
sovereign
right
and
interests
.
”
She
said
that
the
North
was
well
aware
that
the
confrontation
with
the
U.S.
could
continue
into
the
long
term
and
said
the
North
would
do
all
it
can
to
improve
war
deterrence
in
comprehensive
ways
with
the
predicted
threats
and
challenges
in
mind
.
She
warned
,
“
If
the
U.S.
and
its
followers
continue
to
engage
in
reckless
actions
violating
our
sovereign
right
,
we
will
not
just
stand
and
watch
.
”
North
Korea
,
"
Waging
a
war
on
the
Korean
Peninsula
is
a
matter
of
time
"
North
Korea
poured
out
criticism
on
South
Korea
after
it
launched
its
first
military
reconnaissance
satellite
on
December
2
.
The
North
claimed
that
if
it
is
okay
for
the
South
and
the
United
States
to
launch
satellites
,
there
will
be
no
problem
for
the
North
with
launching
its
own
military
reconnaissance
satellite
.
The
Korean
Central
News
Agency
condemned
the
launch
of
South
Korea
’s
reconnaissance
satellite
and
justified
that
of
North
Korea
’s
reconnaissance
satellite
through
speeches
and
commentaries
over
the
last
weekend
.
"
If
our
satellite
launch
is
considered
a
'
violation
'
of
the
North
-
South
military
agreement
,
what
about
the
satellites
our
enemies
have
launched
so
far
?
"
the
North
Korean
military
said
in
a
commentary
.
"
What
about
the
recent
launch
of
the
military
reconnaissance
satellite
that
was
delayed
from
November
30
to
December
2
,
but
was
finally
executed
at
the
behest
of
the
U.S.
military
?
Even
shameless
brats
can
not
insist
that
this
is
what
is
called
'
compliance
with
the
agreement

”
"
If
our
reconnaissance
satellites
are
considered
‘
a
military
threat
'
to
the
United

that
must
be
eliminated
,
then
the
American
spy
satellites
hovering
over
the
Korean
Peninsula
every
hour
of
every
day
and
monitoring
our
key
strategic
points
should
be

First
Aviation
Satellite
on
June
23
South
Korea
succeeded
in
launching
the
first
aviation
satellite
for
the
Korea
Augmentation
Satellite
System
(
KASS
)
.
On
June
23
,
the
Ministry
of
Land
,
Infrastructure
and
Transport
announced
,
“
We
have
successfully
launched
the
first
aviation
satellite
for
the
Korea
Augmentation
Satellite
System
(
KASS
)
to
provide
accurate
location
information
services
throughout
the
entire
country
.
”
The
satellite
lifted
off
from
the
Guiana
Space
Center
in
Kourou
,
French
Guiana
in
South
America
at
6:50
a.m.
June
23
(
6:50
p.m.
June
22
,
local
time
)
.
The
payload
fairing
was
discarded
,
and
the
first
stage
rocket
successfully
separated
,
and
approximately
28
minutes
after
liftoff
,
at
7:18
a.m.
the
satellite
was
successfully
released
.
36,000
km
)
after
twelve
days
and
once
it
settles
into
orbit
,
it
will
undergo
some
signal
tests
and
begin
providing
services
from
2023
.
That
latest
satellite
will
provide
the
Korea
Augmentation
Satellite
System
(
KASS
)
to
provide
accurate
location
information
.
The
system
can
improve
the
GPS
position
error
due
to
the
ionospheric
error
from
15
-
33
meters
to
1
-
1.6
meters
throughout
the
entire
country
.
The
system
is
a
state
-
funded
project
,
and
from
2014
,
when
the
project
was
first
launched
,
until
next
year
,
the
state
plans
to
invest
a
total
of
128
billion
won
into
the
project
.
The
satellite
will
remain
over
South
Korea
,
so
people
can
receive
signals
and
information
for
free
anywhere
throughout
the
nation
24/7
.
The
precise
location
information
is
likely
to
be
used
broadly
in
location
-
based
services
,
including
navigation
services
,
drones
,
autonomous
vehicles
,
and
urban
air
mobility
.
With
the
successful
launch
of
the
satellite
,
South
Korea
became
the
seventh
country
in
the
world
to
have
a
differential
global
positioning
system
(
GPS
)
.
Minister
of

at
the
Korea
Aerospace
Research
Institute
(
KARI
)
in
Daejeon
this
day
and
personally
observed
the
live
broadcast
of
the
satellite
launch
and
encouraged
the
researchers
.
Shortly
after
receiving
news
of
the
successful
launch
,
the
minister
spoke
over
the
phone
with
the
KARI
team
overseeing
the
satellite

and
expressed
his
gratitude
.
In
a
meeting
with
Minister

of
the
Korea
Aerospace
Research
Institute
and
the
Electronics
and
Telecommunication

Institute
and
project
participants
from
KT

announced
,
“
We
were
able
to
accumulate
a
lot
of
expertise
in
the
process
of
developing
the

”
In
particular
,
the
experts
said
,
“
We
are
highly
dependent
on
foreign
technology
for
key
parts
installed
on
the
satellite
,
such
as
the
wireless
amplifier
and
oscillator
,
so
we
urgently
need
to
develop
domestic
technology

Minister
Won
said
,
“
We
need
to

Nervous
15
Minutes
:
Nuri
Smoothly
Soared
into
the
Sky
At
exactly
4
p.m.
June
21
,
when
the
countdown
for
the
second
launch
of
Nuri
reached
zero
,
a
thundering
roar
boomed
from
Naro
Space
Center
in
Goheung
,
Jeollanam
-
do
.
The
reporter
dashed
out
of
the
press
center
set
up
about
3
km
away
from
the
launch
pad
and
looked
up
into
the
sky
.
Nuri
quickly
shot
up
into
the
sky
,
so
fast
that
just
ten
seconds
after
liftoff
,
one
had
to
tilt
one
’s
head
as
far
back
as
possible
to
keep
his
eyes
on
the
rocket
.
It
was
so
fast
that
its
massive
47.2
meter
-
long
body
weighing
200
tons
paled
in
comparison
.
The
thrust
fueled
by
kerosine
,
a
liquid
fuel
,
created
such
a
strong
vibration
that
it
shook
the
grounds
of
the
space
center
.
The
scene
was
similar
to
the
first
launch
last
October
,
and
the
energy
released
by
Nuri
overwhelmed
the
entire
space
center
once
again
.
Nuri
separated
from
the
first
-
stage
rocket
2’3
”
after
liftoff
.
It
released
the
first
-
stage
rocket
into
the
sea
when
it
passed
an
altitude
of
62
km
.
The
weather
around
the
space
center
this
day
was
clear
,
but
due
to
the
high
altitude
,
it
was
difficult
to
confirm
the
separation
of
the
rocket
with
the
naked
eye
.
When
launching
a
projectile
,
space
engineers
focus
a
lot
of
their
efforts
on
this
staging
process
.
Despite
countless
inspections
by
the
researchers
,
unexpected
malfunctions
can
occur
since
the
rocket
is
exposed
to
extreme
conditions
,
such
as
ultra
-
low
temperatures
and
extremely
high
speeds
during
its
flight
.
This
means
when
it
comes
to
Nuri
,
space
engineers
have
to
focus
all
their
attention
on
the
staging
when
the
first
stage
is
discarded
from
the
second
stage
,
and
when
the
third
stage
separates
from
the
second
stage
.
Nuri
successfully
passed
the
first
staging
process
,
discarding
the
first
stage
rocket
without
any
problems
.
Three
minutes
and
47
seconds
after
liftoff
,
Nuri
discarded
the
payload
fairing
at
an
altitude
of
202
km
.
The
fairing
is
a
nose
cone
attached
to
the
top
of
the
third
-
stage
rocket
to
shield
the
cargo
transported
to
space
.
It
is
discarded
during
the
ascent
into
space
to
allow
the
rocket
to
release
a
satellite
into
space
when
necessary
.
In
the
case
of
Nuri
,
the
fairing
covered
a
satellite
to
verify
the
rocket
’s
performance
and
a
dummy
satellite
.
During
the
first
launch
of
Naro
in
2009
,
one
of
the
two
pieces
of
the
fairing
failed
to
separate
,
but
no
such
problem
occurred
on
Nuri
this
day
.
After
4’29
”
from
liftoff
,
Nuri
successfully
discarded
the
second
stage
.
By
then
,
it
had
reached
an
altitude
of
273
km
.
After
a
few
nervous
minutes
,
at
around
13
minutes
after
liftoff
,
Nuri
reached
an
altitude
of
700
km
,
the
destination
of
the
third
-
stage
rocket
.
When
this
news
was
broadcast
throughout
the
Naro
Space
Center
,
people
inside
and
outside
the
space
center
cheered
.
Now
,
all
that
was
left
for
a
successful
mission
was
for
the
Nuri
to
maintain
a
stable
flight
and
set
the
performance
verification
satellite
and
the
dummy
satellite
in
orbit
.
The
third
-
stage
rocket
maintained
an
altitude
of
700
km
and
14’35
”
after
liftoff
put
the
performance
verification
satellite
into
orbit
.
This
successfully
concluded
the
second
launch
of
Nuri
,
which
the
entire
nation
watched
holding
its
breath
.
Forty
-
two
minutes
after
Nuri
left
the
ground
,
the
first
contact
with
the
performance
verification
satellite
was
made
,
and
the
satellite
reported
its
location
to
a
base
station
in
Antarctica
.
This
day
,
Nuri
moved
faster
than
the
researchers
had
expected
.
Initially
,
researchers
expected
Nuri
to
release
the
dummy
satellite
at
16’07
”
after
liftoff
,
but
it
completed
the
mission
22
seconds
ahead
of
schedule
.
The
researchers
explained
the
reason
saying
,
“
The
performance
of
the
engine
shows
minute
differences
depending
on
the
projectile
,
and
the
density
of
the
fuel
can
also
be
slightly
different
.
”
In
an
official
press
briefing
at
the
Naro
Space
Center
,
Lee
Jong
-
ho
,
minister
of
science
and
ICT
said
,
“
I
would
like
to
thank
the
researchers
and

Fourth
Space
Development
Promotion
Plan
:
Unmanned
Landing
on
the
Moon
in
2032
,
on
Mars
in
2045
The
government
will
aggressively
seek
to
enhance
our
national
security
capacity
in
space
.
They
plan
to
secure
the
ability
to
monitor
and
observe
the
Korean
Peninsula
from
space
by
the
2030s
.
They
also
plan
to
launch
an
unmanned
module
to
the
moon
in
2032
and
to
Mars
in
2045
and
will
create
a
space
industry
cluster
in
Jeollanam
-
do
,
Gyeongsangnam
-
do
and
Daejeon
.
The
committee
deliberated
and
made
decisions
on
government
plans
to
designate
a
space
industry
cluster
and
to
develop
an
ultra
-
small
satellite
system
,
as
well
as
the
Fourth
Basic
Plan
for
Space
Development
Promotion
.
The
basic
plan
for
space
development
is
the
top
legal
plan
that
sets
the
mid
to
long
-
term
objective
and
direction
of
the
nation
’s
space
program
.
The
basic
plan
is
established
every
five
years
,
and
the
latest
fourth
plan
will
be
implemented
from
2023
until
2027
.
At
the
center
of
the
fourth
plan
lies
a
specific
goal
to
become
a
powerhouse
in
space
economy
by
2045
.
The
key
objective
of
the
plan
is
to
successfully
land
on
the
moon
in
2032
and
on
Mars
in
2045
,
focusing
on
the
development
of
technology
enabling
South
Korea
to
secure
its
own
ability
for
unmanned
explorations
.
The
plan
also
presented
the
goal
of
securing
the
ability
to
launch
a
manned
spacecraft
in
2045
.
In
particular
,
it
stated
plans
to
develop
the
capacity
to
guarantee
security
in
space
.
The
government
plans
to
expand
the
domestic
surveillance
and
observation
infrastructure
by
the
2030s
and
in
the
2040s
enhance
the
capacity
to
contribute
to
international
cooperation
.
Oh
Tae
-
seok
,
first
vice
minister
of
science
and
ICT
said
,
“
What
’s
characteristic
of
the
fourth
basic
plan
is
that
it
includes
space
security
,
”
and
explained
,
“
It
’s
a
concept
that
includes
the
increase
in
space
security
assets
as
well
as
preparation
for
falling
space
objects
and
collisions
with
them
.
”
When
asked
if
the
expansion
of
surveillance
and
observation
infrastructure
meant
the
development
and
operation
of
reconnaissance
satellites
,
Vice
Minister
Oh
said
,
“
It
is
hard
to
specifically
state
at
this
stage
whether
it
is
a
reconnaissance
satellite
or
not
,
”
and
added
,
“
You
need
to
consider
that
this
is
an
issue
related
to
security
.

On
December
19
,
North
Korea
released
a

to
have
been
captured
by
a
test

The
picture
showed

The
first
launch
of
an
independent

development
from
730
billion
won
in
2021
to
1.5

It
will
also
establish

The
Mighty
Lift
-
off
of
Nuri
Shook
Everyone
Present
:
A
Grand
Finale
after
a
Perfect
19
-
Minute
Flight
When
the
countdown
for
liftoff
reached
zero
at
6:24
p.m.
May
25
,
a
calm
voice
flowed
out
from
the
loudspeaker
in
the
Naro
Space
Center
in
Goheung
,
Jeollanam
-
do
,
“
Engines
ignited
and
lift
off
.
”
At
the
same
time
,
a
thundering
blast
struck
the
ears
throughout
the
space
center
.
It
was
the
moment
of
Nuri
’s
third
launch
.
About
6
-
7
seconds
after
liftoff
,
when
journalists
looked
up
at
the
sky
from
outside
the
press
center
set
up
at
Naro
Space
Center
,
they
could
see
Nuri
,
erect
and
soaring
over
and
beyond
the
mountains
.
The
distance
from
the
launchpad
to
the
press
center
was
over
three
kilometers
,
taking
nearly
an
hour
to
travel
on
foot
.
But
the
noise
and
vibrations
from
the
engine
were
so
overwhelming
,
they
shook
your
entire
body
and
deafened
your
ears
.
That
was
the
power
of
the
first
-
stage
engine
,
which
could
generate
300
tons
of
thrust
.
At
the
tremendous
power
one
can
hardly
experience
in
everyday
life
,
there
was
nothing
you
could
do
other
than
stare
at
Nuri
for
a
while
.
Nuri
,
47.2
meters
long
and
weighing
200
tons
,
steadily
accelerated
.
It
again
displayed
a
performance
proven
in
its
second
launch
last
June
and
continued
its
ascent
to
higher
altitudes
.
Two
minutes
and
three
seconds
after
liftoff
,
the
first
stage
engines
were
detached
and
dropped
into
the
sea
.
Nuri
’s
altitude
at
this
point
was
66
km
,
over
six
times
the
cruising
altitude
of
an
international
passenger
flight
.
The
altitude
was
too
high
for
the
naked
eye
to
see
the
first
stage
separation
.
The
next
stage
proceeded
smoothly
according
to
the
set
sequence
.
When
Nuri
reached
the
altitude
of
209
km
,
3’50
”
after
liftoff
,
the
payload
fairing
was
separated
.
The
payload
fairing
is
the
nose
cone
that
covers
the
top
third
stage
of
the
rocket
.
The
fairing
covered
the
payload
or
freight
that
Nuri
transported
to
space
--
in
this
case
,
eight
satellites
.
This
was
the
moment
when
Nuri
engaged
in
the
primary
mission
of
the
third
launch
,
to
transport
the
satellites
.
Nuri
separated
its
second
stage
engine
4’27
”
after
liftoff
at
an
altitude
of
263
km
.
The
second
stage
engine
dropped
into
the
waters
near
the
Philippines
.
Nuri
successfully
ascended
to
this
point
,
increasing
the
likelihood
for
it
to
successfully
reach
its
target
altitude
of
550
km
as
planned
,
since
all
the
stage
separations
were
completed
.
Problems
in
stage
separation
are
one
of
the
main
reasons
that
a
rocket
fails
to
conduct
a
normal
flight
on
its
way
to
space
.
The
rocket
is
loaded
with
fuel
,
which
it
consumes
quickly
as
soon
as
its
engines
are
ignited
.
Then
when
all
the
fuel
is
consumed
,
it
separates
the
engine
and
drops
it
into
the
sea
.
This
way
,
it
can
lower
its
weight
and
lightly
soar
into
space
.
But
when
a
rocket
ascends
into
space
,
often
problems
occur
when
the
first
stage
separates
from
the
second
stage
or
when
the
second
stage
separates
from
the
third
stage
.
It
’s
a
malfunction
that
frequently
occurs
during
a
rocket
launch
,
since
the
rocket
goes
through
changes
in
pressure
,
temperature
and
velocity
at
extreme
levels
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
.
Nuri
successfully
overcame
the
challenges
without
any
problems
in
the
third
launch
.
The
lone
third
stage
rocket
continued
to
soar
and
13’3
”
after
liftoff
at
an
altitude
of
550
km
,
it
finally
began
separating
the
satellites
.
First
one
up
was
a
next
-
generation
small
satellite
,
NEXTSat-2
.
NEXTSat-2
was
followed
by
seven
mini
-
satellites
or
CubeSats
.
Each
satellite
was
separated
twenty
seconds
apart
.
CubeSats
developed
by
domestic
firms
Justek
,
Lumir
,
and
Cairo
Space
separated
from
the
third
stage
rocket
one
by
one
into
space
.
Finally
,
a
cluster
of
CubeSats
developed
by
the
Korea
Astronomy
&
Space
Science
Institute
,
the
DoyoSats
,
was
released
into
orbit
.
This
happened
15’33
”
after
liftoff
.
However
,
the
Korea
Aerospace
Research
Institute
(
KARI
)
announced
that
they
have
yet
to
confirm
the
separation
of
one
of
the
four
DoyoSats
that
were
released
.
KARI
and
the
Ministry
of
Science
and
ICT
announced
that
most
of
the
satellites
were
successfully
put
in
an
orbit
circling
the
Earth
while
maintaining
an
altitude
of
550
km
.
This
was
the
moment
that
the
third
launch
was
declared
successful
.
When
the
announcement
that
the
deployment
of
the
satellites
was
complete
flowed
from
the
speakers
at
the
Naro
Space
Center
,
people
broke
into
applause
and
cheers
.
Even
after
the
satellites
were
completely
separated
,
Nuri
continued
to
remain
in
flight
until
18’58
”
after
liftoff
.
It
sprayed
the
remaining
fuel
like
a
sprayer
distancing
itself
from
the
satellites
.
It
successfully
completed
its
mission
by
performing
a
maneuver
to
reduce
the
risk
of
crashing
into
the
satellites
.
In
an
official
briefing
at
the
Naro
Space
Center
Thursday
,
Minister
of
Science
and
ICT
Lee
Jong
-
ho
said
,
“
All
the
way
to
the
third
launch
this
day
,
we
have
ensured
the
reliability
of
Nuri
and
at
the
same
time
reaffirmed
our
possibility
to
operate
various
satellites
and
conduct
space
explorations
as
well
as
provide
launch
services
.
”
“
Successful
Launch
of
Nuri
,
But
...
”
The
Nation
Is
Abuzz
after
the
Censure
of
a
Korean
Scientist
The
successful
launch
of
Nuri
on
June
21
made
South
Korea
the
seventh
country
in
the
world
that
could
launch
a
1
-
ton
satellite
into
orbit
and
praise
has
continued
for
the
scientists
at
the
Korea
Aerospace
Research
Institute
(
KARI
)
responsible
for
the
feat
.
However
,
some
point
out
that
the
hard
work
by
the
scientists
should
not
be
interpreted
simply
in
terms
a
sense
of
duty
to
the
nation
.
The
researchers
receive
wages
that
are
low
compared
to
their
workload
,
and
they
do
n’t
receive
a
fair
overtime
pay
even
if
they
conduct
research
late
into
the
night
.
Sometimes
,
they
even
have
to
go
on
business
trips
to
other
areas
in
Korea
spending
their
own
money
.
These
complaints
are
exploding
particularly
among
the
younger
researchers
in
Blind
,
an
anonymous
professional
network
.
The
KARI
labor
union
plans
to
announce
its
position
on
the
working
conditions
and
benefits
of
researchers
next
week
.
On
June
22
,
the
day
after
the
successful
launch
of
Nuri
,
someone
posted
on
Blind
,
“
The
Uncomfortable
Truth
Behind
the
Success
of
Nuri
.
”
According
to
the
post
,
a
researcher
who
just
graduated
from
a
doctoral
program
receives
a
salary
of
52
million
won
a
year
at
the
Korea
Aerospace
Research
Institute
.
A
,
an
official
at
KARI
said
,
“
Researchers
in
their
early
forties
or
younger
receive
about
10
million
won
less
than
researchers
at
other
government
research
institutions
like
the
Electronics
and
Telecommunications
Research
Institute
(
ETRI
)
and
the
Korea
Atomic
Energy
Research
Institute
(
KAERI
)
.
”
A
look
at
last
year
’s
average
wages
on
ALIO
,
All
Public
Information
In
-
One
,
a
system
that
provides
all
business
information
on
public
agencies
,
shows
similar
results
.
The
wage
at
the
Korea
Aerospace
Research
Institute
(
95
million
won
)
is
lower
than
the
wage
at
the
KAERI
(
120
million
won
)
and
ETRI
(
115
million
won
)
.
A
bigger
problem
is
overtime
pay
.
In
the
case
of
KARI
,
researchers
have
to
concentrate
their
research
capacity
when
a
time
is
set
for
a
particular
launch
.
The
person
who
posted
the
complaint
on
Blind
wrote
,
“
Researchers
do
n’t
receive
any
compensation
even
if
they
work
until
2
-
3
in
the
morning
and
on
weekends
.
”
B
,
another
employee
at
KARI
said
,
“
Even
if
our
working
hours
are
flexible
,
the
structure
is
basically
a
comprehensive
wage
system
.
”
Since
researchers
fail
to
receive
adequate
legal
compensation
when
they
work
overtime
,
many
in
the
research
institute
are
discontent
.
The
Korea
Aerospace
Research
Institute
is
also
stingy
in
paying
for
business
trip
expenses
.
The
travel
expenses
for
domestic
trips
are
based
on
KTX
fees
,
but
when
researchers
go
to
smaller
cities
with
no
access
to
KTX
trains
,
travel
expenses
are
calculated
based
on
intercity
bus
fares
.
However
,
taking
the
bus
often
requires
long
waits
,
so
researchers
usually
drive
their
own
cars
instead
.
In
this
case
,
the
research
institute
pays
for
the
gas
,
but
they
only
pay
1,800
won
per
liter
.
According
to
Opinet
on
June
24
,
the
average
price
of
unleaded
gasoline
was
2,126
won
per
liter
.
The
roundtrip
travel
expenses
for
a
business
trip
to
Goheung
,
where
the
Naro
Space
Center
is
located
,
was
recently
raised
to
100,000
won
.
However
,
researchers
still
have
to
go
to
other
cities
like
Ansan
,
Cheonan
and
Changwon
as
well
as
more
remote
areas
inland
,
so
they
still
suffer
inconveniences
.
The
research
institute
pays
50,000
-
60,000
won
per
night
for
accommodations
and
the
cost
of
a
meal
is
set
at
8,300
won
,
which
is
not
sufficient
when
considering
consumer
prices
.
According
to
researchers
at
the
aerospace
institute
,
the
problem
is
that
the
institute
applies
business
trip
standards
for
general
civil
servants
who
work
in
the
office
.
This
fails
to
reflect
the
characteristics
of
the
work
handled
by
KARI
researchers
,
who
have
to
travel
to
all
corners
of
the
nation
.
The
KARI
labor
union
is
expected
to
release
its
position
on
the
working
conditions
and
benefits
for
researchers
next
week
.

reconnaissance
flights
in

On
November
22
,
the
Democratic
People
’s
Republic
of
Korea
(
DPRK
)
announced
it
successfully
launched
the
military
reconnaissance
satellite
,
Malligyong-1
,
and
that
it
would
officially
begin
its
spy
operations
on
December
1
.
The
South
Korean
government
immediately
responded
by
scrapping
the
no
-
fly
zone
designated
in
Clause
3
,
Article
1
of
the
September
19
Military
Agreement
with
North
Korea
and
warned
that
it
would
engage
in
aggressive
aerial
monitoring
and
reconnaissance
activities
.
Wednesday
,
the
Korean
Central
News
Agency
reported
that
the
National
Aerospace
Development
Administration
(
NADA
)
successfully
launched
the
new
rocket
,
Chollima-1
carrying
the
spy
satellite

The
DPRK
officially
announced
its
success
on
its
third
try
after
acknowledging
failed
launches
in
May
and
August
.
North
Korean
leader
Kim
Jong
-
un
boasted
about
the
nation
’s
nuclear
capability
and
said
,
“
The
military
power
of
the
Republic
has
secured
eyes
that
can
see
far
and
a
strong
punch
that
can
strike
far
.
”
The
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff
released
a
notice
on
Wednesday
afternoon
announcing
,
“
The
so
-
called
military
reconnaissance
satellite
launched
by
the
DPRK
is
believed
to
have
entered
orbit
,
”
and
,
“
Additional
analyses
are
necessary
to
determine
whether
it
is
operating
properly
.
”
The
South
Korean
government
began
scrapping
some
articles
of
the
September
19
Military
Agreement
four
hours
after
the
launch
of
North
Korea
’s
spy
satellite
.
President
Yoon
Suk
-
yeol
,
currently
on
a
state
visit
to
the
United
Kingdom
,
presided
over
an
emergency
standing
committee
meeting
of
the
National
Security
Council
in
London
on
November
21
(
local
time
)
and
decided
and
approved
such
measures
.
This
was
the
first
time
that
South
Korea
first
dismissed
an
inter
-
Korean
agreement
.
After
signing
the
September
19
Military
Agreement
in
2018
,
the
DPRK
violated
the
agreement
several
times
,
but
never
said
it
would
abandon
the
agreement
.
Thus
the
South
Korean
government
may
come
under
fire
for
hastily
suspending
the
military
agreement
,
which
helped
prevent
military
threats
and
clashes
in
border
regions
.
The
situation
in
the
Korean
Peninsula
,
which
is
escalating
toward
a
hardline
versus
hardline
confrontation
,
is
expected
to
cool
even
further
.
The
government
warned
of
aggressive
operations
in
the
forefront
after
scrapping
some
of
the
military
agreement
and
is
reviewing
additional
measures
such
as
separate
sanctions
and
discussions
in
the
UN
Security
Council
.

aircraft
carrier
which
entered
the
Busan
military
port
Wednesday
and
called
for
thorough
preparedness
requesting
plans
for
joint
maritime
exercises
by
the
ROK
and
the
U.S.
and
by
the
ROK
,

Chairman
Kim
mentioned
USS

’s
docking
in
Busan
and
said
,
“
The
U.S.
is
turning
South
Korea
into
an
outpost
for
military
forces
of
aggression
.
”
The
North
Korean
leader
also
said
he
would
launch
more
and
diverse
reconnaissance
satellites
,
and
the
South
Korean
government
is
also
considering
scrapping
additional
articles
of
the
September
19
Military
Agreement
depending
on
future
movements
by
