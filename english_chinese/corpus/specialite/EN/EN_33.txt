With the value of the space sector estimated at more than $450 billion annually, and after a third consecutive record-breaking year in terms of satellites launched into outer space, the governance and long-term sustainability of outer space activities, space debris mitigation and space resources will remain high on the agenda of Member States’ efforts to maintain outer space for peaceful purposes. Space is integral to our daily lives, and with 102 member states actively engaged, the work of this rapidly growing intergovernmental forum will remain at the forefront of space exploration and safe use.  As a capacity-builder, the Office will leverage its comparative advantages and expertise in space law, policy, science and technology. Through unique public-private partnerships, the Office will provide targeted and inclusive opportunities to develop space-capable workforces and space-based solutions for national needs and global challenges, and support the Sustainable Development Goals (“Space4SDGs”). The Office will continue to promote the implementation of the outer space treaties, including the registration of objects launched into space, and advance the preparedness of countries to address disaster risks and improve their climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience.   The Office will further seek to build transparency and resilience around these core mandates, promoting space in global agendas and summits and advocating for treaty compliance and access to space for all.

The Office will also pursue cooperative relationships, including with the private sector, to identify new mechanisms for providing access to space. It will enhance transparency in its programme activities and regularly inform the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space of the projects being implemented and of its partnerships with space agencies, governmental and non-governmental organizations and the private sector. Part II Political affairs  23-05214 6/18   6.8 With regard to inter-agency coordination and liaison, the Office will lead the Inter-Agency Meeting on Outer Space Activities (UN-Space) to promote coherence in the space-related work of entities of the United Nations system.   6.9 The Office integrates a gender perspective in its operational activities, deliverables and results, as appropriate, as demonstrated by the implementation of its Space for Women project to promote the empowerment of women and girls in the areas of space science, technology, innovation and exploration, and to increase awareness of education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The Space for Women project will work with partners to strengthen the capacity and skills of individuals and institutions, with an emphasis on enhancing the participation of women and girls in space activities.   6.10 In line with the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy and through its Space for Persons with Disabilities project, the Office raises awareness and identifies opportunities for disability inclusion in the space sector. The Office will develop partnerships to enhance the prospects of careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics for people with disabilities and will share good practices for accessibility in scientific research, education and outreach, and publish related information through a dedicated webpage with accessible features.      Impact of the pandemic and lessons learned     6.11 The continuation of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic into 2022 had an impact on the implementation of mandates, in particular on holding the annual sessions of intergovernmental bodies and a number of capacity-building, outreach and awareness-raising activities ordinarily held in-person. The Office conducted some activities in a hybrid or fully virtual format, with adjusted delivery schedules, and as necessary, postponed, relocated or cancelled certain activities. For example, the Office facilitated the involvement of participants affected by travel restrictions by organizing meetings and workshops in a hybrid format. Furthermore, a workshop and training course on disaster management and emergency response was relocated, and selected hyper-gravity experiments were postponed.  6.12 The Office continues to mainstream the lessons learned and best practices concerning the COVID-19-related adjustments to and adaptation of the programme, including integrating the use of virtual and hybrid mechanisms in the design of capacity-building activities and replicating pragmatic solutions to respond to travel restrictions. This includes embedding locally recruited experts in national disaster management institutions, expanding online courses to other subject areas and organizing demonstrations and simulations guided by experts for smaller groups of targeted  practitioners and professionals.     Evaluation activities    6.13 The self-evaluation of the information technology and communications needs of the Office completed in 2022 has guided the proposed programme plan for 20
The results and lessons of the evaluation referenced above have been taken into account for the proposed programme plan for 20
For example, the evaluation identified compliance gaps and opportunities to rationalize and modernize infrastructure. The Office will strengthen the hosting of its websites, databases and portals, upgrading websites and portals as necessary, to enhance the security and backup of those systems and facilitate their automatic updating to ensure continued compliance with United Nations policies and guidelines. The Office will also modernize its website to streamline content in a user-friendly way and to ensure alignment with United Nations standards.  6.15 The evaluation on the activities of the Space4Women platform conducted by the Office is planned for 20
Section 6 Peaceful uses of outer space  7/18 23-05214    Programme performance in 2022     Strengthened partnerships in the use of space applications for agriculture and climate change   6.16 The Office established new partnerships with space agencies and other entities offering training in the use of space applications for agriculture and climate change, to extend the courses to participants from developing countries. Adapted training content was developed for government officials, educators and young professionals, including case studies, demonstrations of state-of-the-art applications and hands-on technical training on data platforms to provide an interactive learning experience. The Office facilitated the delivery of the courses online and encouraged the exchange of ideas between global participants, generating connections between user communities and subject matter experts. The courses are accessible on the Office’s website.   6.17 Progress towards the objective is presented in the performance measure below (see figure 6.I).

Figure 6.III Performance measure: cumulative number of countries taking action to increase understanding, adhere to and/or implement the international legal regime governing outer space activities        Result 3: Direct access to space-based emergency response mechanisms    Proposed programme plan for 2024    6.22 The International Charter on Space and Major Disasters is an international initiative among space agencies that provides satellite-derived data to emergency responders in the event of a major disaster. Access to this mechanism requires a national management authority to be an authorized user, thereby 82 388 700 528 800 01002003004005006007008009002020(actual)2021(actual)2022(actual)2023(planned)2024(planned)17 25 39 41 52 01020304050602020(actual)2021(actual)2022(actual)2023(planned)2024(planned)Section 6 Peaceful uses of outer space  9/18 23-05214  requiring those countries without direct access to request assistance through one of the international organizations that collaborate with the Charter.     Lessons learned and planned change   6.23 The lesson for the Office was the demand to scale-up support to national experts in order for them to have quick access to free-of-charge shared satellite imagery in situ in an affected country, instead of having to wait for map and related information products to be provided or facilitated by other authorized users or collaborating organizations.  6.24 In applying the lesson, the Office will raise awareness among and provide training to national disaster management focal points and data scientists in national management authorities from developing countries that do not yet have direct access to the mechanism, in order to build their capacity to download and process data and work with satellite imagery for rapid mapping. The programme will support focal points, when requested, in the activation of the International Charter. As authorized users, national management authorities will be able to communicate directly with the Charter, thereby reducing the number of intermediaries in the process and enabling faster delivery of the remote-sensed imagery or derived information products to local authorities responding to an emergency.  6.25 Expected progress towards the objective is presented in the performance measure below (see figure 6.IV).

Extrabudgetary resources    6.32 As reflected in tables 6.5 (2) and 6.6 (2) extrabudgetary resources amounting to $1,584,800 would provide for $772,300 under posts or 7 posts (2 P-3, 2 P-2/1 and 3 GS (OL)), and $812,500 under non-post resources. The resources would complement regular budget resources and would provide for capacity development activities and other services to Member States. The anticipated increase amounting to $243,000 reflects the planned delivery of additional capacity-building activities and technical advisory assistance to Member States.  6.33 Anticipated in-kind contributions with an estimated value of $1,330,000 reflect staff provided on a non-reimbursable loan basis, expert support and launch services provided under the Access to Space for All initiative and the value of the rental of conference facilities, meeting services, room and board for participants, transport and other contractual services provided on a no-cost basis for training events and other activities organized by the Office.  Part II Political affairs  23-05214 16/18   6.34 The authority to oversee the use of extrabudgetary resources rests with the Office in accordance with the delegation of authority from the Secretary-General.   6.35 In accordance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular target 12.6 of the Sustainable Development Goals, in which organizations are encouraged to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycles, and in compliance with the cross-cutting mandate set out in paragraph 19 of General Assembly resolution 72/219, the Office complies with the policies and procedures rolled out by the United Nations Office at Vienna. The Vienna headquarters is a climate neutral facility, running 100 per cent on renewable energy. Since 2020, the Vienna-based organizations of the common systems started to renew entrances, replaced existing air-curtains and upgraded/refurbished all elevator cabins. While some of those projects have been completed in parts of the compound, they are still ongoing in others, combined with an increased focus on upgrading air conditioning units, replacing pipes and insulation and lightning systems throughout the Vienna International Centre from the 1978 standards. The projects, which will continue through 2024 and beyond, will result in a further reduction of the environmental impact of the Vienna International Centre as they will increase energy efficiency.  6.36 Information on compliance with the timely submission of documentation and advance booking for air travel is reflected in table 6.
Advance purchasing of some tickets was restricted owing to operational constraints arising from the late availability of extrabudgetary funding sources. The Office will review late bookings to mitigate instances that have an impact on compliance.

The Committee trusts that updated information on the recruitment status of these two posts will be provided to the General Assembly at the time of its consideration of the present report and at the next programme budget submission (see para. II.144). The recruitment for the D-2 Director and D-1 Senior Adviser posts are in the final stages of selection of candidates, and onboarding is expected in second half of 20
