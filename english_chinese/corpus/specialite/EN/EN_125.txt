At the 855th meeting, on 30 January, the Chair of the Subcommittee made a statement outlining the work of the Subcommittee at its current session. She brought to the attention of the Subcommittee several provisions of General Assembly resolution 71/90 pertaining to the current work of the Subcommittee and drew particular attention to the fact that the General Assembly had emphasized the significant progress in the development of space science and technology and their applications that had enabled humans to explore the universe, and the extraordinary achievements made in space exploration efforts. She noted that the General Assembly had recognized the unique platform at the global level for international cooperation in space activities represented by the Committee and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and Legal Subcommittee and assisted by the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the Secretariat. 
At the same meeting, the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs made a statement in which she reviewed the work carried out by the Office during the previous year and presented a detailed description of activities planned for the coming year, including outreach activities and cooperation and coordination with United Nations entities and international intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. She provided a comprehensive account of the work of the Office in support of the objectives of the plan of work for the thematic cycle dedicated to the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations Conference on the Exploration and 6/51 V.17-01120 A/AC.105/1138 Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, in 2018 (UNISPACE+50). She stressed the current unfavourable financial situation of the Office and highlighted the importance of having financial and other resources available for the successful implementation of the programme of work of the Office. 
The Subcommittee welcomed with appreciation the designation of Scott Kelly, former astronaut of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), as United Nations Champion for Space. His role would involve supporting the Office for Outer Space Affairs in promoting space as a tool for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and in raising awareness of the Office ’s activities, including activities related to UNISPACE+
The Subcommittee noted the remarkable convergence of anniversaries in 2017: the year marked the sixtieth anniversary of the advent of the space age with the launch into outer space of the first artificial Earth satellite, Sputnik I, on 4 October 1957; the fiftieth anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies; the fiftieth anniversary of the Landsat programme; the tenth anniversary of the International Heliophysical Year; and the tenth anniversary of the endorsement by the General Assembly of the Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. In addition, the sixtieth session of the Committee on t he Peaceful Uses of Outer Space would be held in 2
The Subcommittee welcomed the opportunity presented by those anniversaries to increase awareness of the relevance to and importance of space applications for the betterment of the conditions of human l ife. 
The Subcommittee agreed that, without space science and technology, and in particular without communication and navigation systems, it would be impossible to meet the current and future challenges of social and economic development and sustainability, such as natural disasters, food security, climate change and natural resource security. The Subcommittee emphasized that space activities were also crucial to supporting sustainable development, especially as part of efforts to support sustainable economic growth, improve quality of life and manage the global environment. 
The Subcommittee noted the instrumental role it had played in the development of the legal regime governing the use of outer space activities for peaceful purposes and in efforts to provide a unique multilateral platform at the global level for enhancing international cooperation for the benefit of all countries, in particular in the area of using space applications for sustainable development, including within the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
The Subcommittee welcomed the adoption of the African Space Policy and Strategy by the African Union Heads of State and Government during the twenty-sixth session of the African Union, held in Addis Ababa on 30 and 31 January 2016, a milestone achievement that marked the first concrete steps towards the realization of an African outer space programme within the framework of the African Union’s Agenda 2
The Subcommittee noted that the Government of the Bolivarian Republi c of Venezuela and the Bolivarian Agency for Space Activities would host the Eighth Space Conference of the Americas and the Second Venezuelan Conference on Space Technology, to be held in parallel in Caracas from 11 to 15 September 2

The Subcommittee stressed the importance of the Outer Space Treaty for the orderly conduct of international cooperation in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space. The Subcommittee also stressed that the Treaty played an important role in the regulation of various aspects of international cooperative activities aimed at the development of, inter alia, space science and technology and their applications. 
The view was expressed that it was important to ensure that the delicate formulations of the provisions of the Treaty were understood and followed in a uniform manner by States and other participants in space activities, as there were emerging instances of severe deviations from that important practice. The Treaty stipulated that there should be freedom of scientific investigation in outer space and that outer space should be free for exploration and use. Some politicians and experts, in their interpretations, appealed irresponsibly to a non -existing principle of “freedom of action in space”. 
Some delegations reaffirmed the commitment of their countries to the peaceful use and exploration of outer space and emphasized the following principles: universal access, on an equal and non-discriminatory basis, to outer space for all States, irrespective of their level of scientific, technical and economic development; non-appropriation of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, by claim of sovereignty, use, appropriation, occupation or any other means; th e commitment by States to the use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes, as a common heritage of humankind; the non-militarization of outer space, the non-placement of weapons in outer space and the strict use of outer space for the improvement of living conditions and peace on the planet; and international and regional cooperation to promote the development of space activities. 
Some delegations expressed the view that the Outer Space Treaty and other space treaties had been serving the international community well during the previous decades and that those instruments remained as relevant as before. That important point should be kept in mind as work continued on other areas of space governance, such as the long-term sustainability guidelines or transparency and confidence-building measures. The delegations expressing that view were also of the view that, as human space activity continued to multiply at an ever faster rate, it was important for the international community to ensure safety and sec urity in outer space by complying with international space law as it existed at the current time. 
The view was expressed that a thesis on global space governance or management did not have any substantive content or meaning, except for some States that tended to prioritize national regulations of space activities and were predisposed to taking egocentric approaches with regard to the exploration and use of outer space. 
The view was expressed that there would be no prospect of arriving at what could be termed “space traffic management” without a preliminary consensus among States about an efficient and suitable international and multilateral system for regulating the safety of space operations. The delegation expressing that view was also of the view that a rapid introduction of space traffic rules, as some were advocating, would inevitably run into numerous complex issues that would be more suitably resolved as part of the development of the guidelines for the long -term sustainability for outer space activities. 
Some delegations expressed the view that international and regional cooperation in the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space for the purpose of meeting global development goals was essential for States and should thus be continuously strengthened through the Committee and its Subcommittees. The Committee and its Subcommittees should remain a central international forum for those matters. In that regard it would be essential to explore various options for strengthening the capabilities of the Office for Outer Space Affairs so that it could actively contribute to the promotion of capacity-building and technical assistance in 8/51 V.17-01120 A/AC.105/1138 space science and technology and their applications for the benefit of all States, in particular developing States. 
The view was expressed that space technology was a driving force for socioeconomic development, and that that role was expanding at an extraordinary rate. The delegation expressing that view was also of the view that space technology should be made available to all countries in an unhindered and non-discriminatory manner, taking into particular account the needs of developing countries. 
Some delegations expressed the view that, given the impact of space activities on human life and the environment and the current sta te of technological advances, coupled with the increasingly prominent role played by new private actors, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and the Legal Subcommittee should enhance their interaction and coordination in a way that promoted the progr essive development of international law and its codification and furthered the establishment of binding international norms governing issues critical in the use and exploration of outer space. 
The view was expressed that the question regarding the permissi bility of applying an exclusively technocratic approach to the matters of the exploration and use of resources of celestial bodies would require consideration within the context of UNISPACE+
The delegation expressing that view was also of the view that it was a matter of the grave concern that there was a growing trend of dispersion of that important problem between various forums, including the Hague Space Resources Governance Working Group, when it should be considered only by the Committee and its Subcommittees. In that connection, it would be opportune to consider the advantages of the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, which had been commended by the General Assembly and constituted an important part of the body of international space law. The Agreement had a relatively small number of parties owing to the effect of “delayed decision”, as many States had decided to take time for further consideration of the development of relevant technology and the pe rspectives for space resources exploration. Therefore, it would be possible to consider, within the framework of the Subcommittee, a simultaneous joint accession of the leading space-faring nations to the Agreement, to be followed by similar actions by oth er States. 
The view was expressed that the series of ballistic missile launches in 2016 by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea should be condemned, as they were in violation of relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolution 2270 (2016) and resolution 2321 (2016), pursuant to which scientific and technical cooperation that could contribute to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was prohibited. The delegation expressing that view was also of the view that Member States should faithfully implement those resolutions. 
The Subcommittee expressed its gratitude to the organizers of the following events, held on the margins of the current session of the Subcommittee: (a) Evening event on the theme “India in space: the forward look to international cooperation”, organized by ESPI; (b) Evening event on the theme “Planetary defence: technical, legal and economic aspects”, organized by the national point of contact for space law for Austria of the European Centre for Space Law and the Museum of Natural History, Vienna; (c) Tutorial and workshop sessions on the theme “Landsat past, present and future: accessing the United States Geological Survey land remote sensing archive ”, organized by the delegation of the United States; V.17-01120 9/51 A/AC.105/1138 (d) Special panel session and official book launch for Fragility and Beauty: My Planet From Space, organized jointly by the Office for Outer Space Affairs and ESA; (e) Side event on the theme “Long-term sustainability guidelines implementation: an open dialogue”, organized by the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom; (f) Special panel session on the theme “Space for women”, held to mark the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, on 11 Febru ary, organized by the Office for Outer Space Affairs.

The Subcommittee noted with satisfaction that the eleventh meeting of ICG and the seventeenth meeting of the Providers’ Forum, organized by Roscosmos on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation, had been held in Sochi, Russian Federation, from 6 to 10 November 2
The Subcommittee noted that the items on the ICG meeting agenda covered compatibility and interoperability of satellite navigation systems; reference frames and timing; enhancement of GNSS performance; and development of new navigation services and capabilities. It also noted that ICG wa s progressing significantly in establishing an interoperable GNSS space service volume, and that exploiting the interoperability between all systems had allowed achievement of GNSS signal availability of very close to 100 per cent. 
The Subcommittee welcomed the proposal by ICG for the Subcommittee to consider issues related to GNSS spectrum protection and interference detection and mitigation under its current agenda item on recent developments in GNSS. The Subcommittee noted that the intent behind the proposal was to raise awareness of the issue among States members of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space as part of efforts to promote the effective use of GNSS open services by the global community. 
The Subcommittee noted that the twelfth meeting of ICG would be hosted by Japan, in Kyoto, from 2 to 7 December 2
The Subcommittee also noted the expression of interest by China in hosting the thirteenth meeting of ICG, in 2018, by India to host the fourteenth meeting, in 2019, and by the Office for Outer Space Affairs to host the fifteenth meeting, in 2
The Subcommittee also noted that the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United States continued to be a central pillar in the expansion of GNSS coverage and use, and that GPS accuracy currently averaged a user range error of 70 centimetres. It was noted that the United States continued to broadcast GPS signals free of direct user charges and continued to strongly support international cooperation for peaceful civil, commercial and scientifi c purposes among current and future GNSS providers. 
The Subcommittee further noted that the United States had completed its implementation of the 12 GPS Block IIF satellites, which had led to incremental increases in overall system performance and more satellites transmitting the new civilian GPS signals known as “L2C” and “L5”. The Subcommittee noted that the United States continued to work toward the launch of the next generation of satellites, GPS Block III, which would provide improved service with the broadcast of the third civilian signal, “L1C”. Work on an upgraded ground control system, called “OCX”, in support of the new GPS Block III satellites, would also continue. 
The Subcommittee noted that the satellite-aided search and rescue programme known as Cospas-Sarsat, for which the Medium-altitude Earth Orbit Search and Rescue (MEOSAR) distress signals relayed by GPS and Galileo of the European Union were in early operational capability, had been used in search and rescue efforts. It also noted that the MEOSAR system had been using upgraded GPS satellites, GLONASS of the Russian Federation and Galileo of the European Union, orbiting in space at an altitude of between 19,000 and 24,000 km. It further noted that the MEOSAR system provided near-instantaneous distress alerts and locations 26/51 V.17-01120 A/AC.105/1138 as well as significantly more satellites compared with the current constellations used in search and rescue. 
The Subcommittee also noted that the civilian services of GLONASS were provided free of direct user charges, were accessible, effective and fully responsive to the needs of different users and that the launch of the latest GLONASS -M navigation satellite into orbit supported the space segment of the system. 
The Subcommittee further noted that the System of Differential Correction and Monitoring, an augmentation of GLONASS, continued to be updated and was to be used in civil aviation for enhancing navigation precision. The provision of GLONASS-based precise point positioning to support applications requiring real-time access was being organized. 
The Subcommittee noted that the interface control document for GLONASS Code Division Multiple Access signals in bands L1, L2 and L3 had been published. An open service performance standard was currently being developed, which demonstrated commitment to providing a basic performance standard for the system’s users. The Subcommittee also noted that international cooperation existed that was aimed at making GLONASS an essential element of the international GNSS infrastructure, with benefits for users worldwide. 
The Subcommittee also noted that the initial services of the European GNSS Galileo had been declared operational in December 2
Galileo provided a range of state-of-the-art positioning, navigation and timing services to users worldwide. The Galileo constellation consisted of 18 satellites; however, the full constellation would consist of a total of 30 satellites and was expected to be completed by 2
The Subcommittee further noted that the BeiDou Navigation Satellite Syst em, a global navigation satellite system compatible with other GNSS, had been established by China. The System was in full service and had provided positioning, navigation, timing and short-message communication services to the Asia-Pacific region since 2
A new generation of satellites had been tested and verified in 2016, and between six and eight satellites were scheduled to be launched in 2
The System would constitute a complete space constellation and would provide global coverage by 2
The Subcommittee noted that India was currently implementing its satellite navigation programme, which consisted of two systems: the GPS -aided Geostationary-augmented Navigation System (GAGAN), which was a satellite based augmentation system, and the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), which was an independent regional system. GAGAN had been certified for Navigation Performance, 0.1 Nautical Mile service level and for Approach with Vertical Precision certification by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation of India, thus enabling en route navigation and precision approach services using GAGAN. The Subcommittee also noted that, in addition to using GAGAN in the aviation sector, India was taking initiatives to use it in non -aviation sectors. 
The Subcommittee also noted that the IRNSS constellation, also known as NavIC, provided satellite-based navigation services. It consisted of seven satellites: three in geostationary orbits and four in geosynchronous orbits. All the seven IRNSS satellites, including IRNSS 1A and IRNSS 1G, had been put into orbit using the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle of India. The IRNSS signal in space was being broadcast by IRNSS satellites and was being received successfully. 
The Subcommittee further noted that the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS), a Japanese satellite positioning system composed mainly of satellites in quasi-zenith orbits, was being developed, and that Michibiki, the first QZSS satellite, was currently performing all its functions. The QZSS satellite po sitioning function, which was compatible and interoperable with GPS, had been enabled to extend availability time by sharing the same positioning signals. In addition to positioning and GPS augmentation, QZSS could provide a messaging service that would contribute to disaster management. V.17-01120 27/51 A/AC.105/1138 
The Subcommittee noted that QZSS would be expanded and upgraded to become an operational regional satellite-based navigation system to improve positioning in the Asia-Pacific region. A constellation of four satellites would be established and the formal operation would begin during the 2018 Japanese fiscal year. A constellation of seven satellites would enable sustainable positioning to be completed by around the 2023 Japanese fiscal year. 
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation that Indonesia, Mexico and Pakistan had reported on their projects and activities in the use of GNSS technology for environmental management and protection, disaster risk reduction, agriculture and food security, emergency response, more efficient surveying and mapping and safer and more effective transportation by land, sea and air, as well as ionospheric and tropospheric scientific research. They had also reported on their efforts to ensure the participation of international partners in those projec ts and activities. VIII. Space weather

The Subcommittee also noted that, in order to foster international cooperation in the interests of maintaining continuous space weather monitoring in the future, including by filling gaps, as appropriate, it was critical to have op en access to interoperable data. In that regard, the Subcommittee welcomed the progress made by the International Space Weather Initiative (ISWI) and noted with satisfaction the adoption by the ISWI steering committee of an open data policy, as presented t o the Subcommittee (see A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.8). 
The Subcommittee further noted a number of national activities undertaken in space weather research, training and education to improve scientific an d technical understanding of adverse space weather effects, with the aim of strengthening space weather resilience. 
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation a number of global conferences and workshops held and planned on space weather, including the Unite d Nations/United States workshop entitled “International Space Weather Initiative: the decade after the International Heliophysical Year 2007 ”, to be held in Boston, United States, from 31 July to 4 August 2017, which would be directly relevant to UNISPACE+50 thematic priority 
The Subcommittee noted that that workshop would mark the tenth anniversary of the International Heliophysical Year 2007, which had led to the creation of ISWI. The Subcommittee also noted that the workshop would focus on recent adv ances made in scientific research by utilizing ISWI instrument data in conjunction with space mission data to acquire significant new knowledge about space weather phenomena near Earth and in interplanetary space, and that the inputs received from the workshop would be used to further advance the work undertaken under UNISPACE+50 thematic priority 
The Subcommittee also noted that the Expert Group on Space Weather would be invited to contribute to the United Nations/United States workshop, in particular to the high-level international forum on the economic and societal effects of extreme space weather, which would be held on the first two days of the workshop. 
The Subcommittee further noted that the Expert Group would engage in a number of other space weather workshops around the world and that it was planning to hold a meeting and workshop dedicated to UNISPACE+50 thematic priority 4 on V.17-01120 29/51 A/AC.105/1138 27 and 28 April 2017, on the margins of the congress of the European Geosciences Union to be held in Vienna, with the support of the Office for Outer Space Affairs. 
The Subcommittee noted that the Office for Outer Space Affairs, as the body leading the Inter-Agency Meeting on Outer Space Activities (UN-Space), was preparing a special report on space weather, to be issued for consideration by the Committee at its sixtieth session, in June 2017, in the context of the preparations for UNISPACE+
The view was expressed that space weather was an important element in the effort to ensure the long-term sustainability of outer space activities and that it was important to work collaboratively towards an international framework of space weather services as part of UNISPACE+
At the 864th meeting of the Subcommittee, on 3 February, the rapporteur of the Expert Group on Space Weather presented the progress that the Expert Group had made on the margins of the current session of the Subcommittee, stressing the importance of working towards achieving the objectives of UNISPACE+50 thematic priority 
At its meetings held on the margins of the fifty-fourth session of the Subcommittee, which had been attended by more than 27 experts from 20 countries, the Expert Group had welcomed the mandate given to it by the Committee to work as the mechanism under UNISPACE+50 thematic priority 4, with t he substantive support of the Office for Outer Space Affairs. The Expert Group had also welcomed the fact that, under the mechanism, space weather-related activities were also to be implemented through the capacity-building activities of the Office and through the role of the Office as the executive secretariat of ICG. The Expert Group had underlined that important synergies existed between the tasks set out in its existing workplan as endorsed by the Subcommittee in 2015 (A/AC.105/1088, para. 169) and the objectives of thematic priority 
In that regard, the Expert Group had agreed to focus, during the coming year, on the preparation of a report for the mitigation of space weather effects, to be considered by the Subcommittee and the Committee as part of UNISPACE+50 in 2
The Expert Group had agreed to build on the successful outcomes of a space weather workshop entitled “From scientific discovery to applications, services and infrastructure protection” that it hosted on the margins of the fifty-third session of the Subcommittee, in February 2
In that regard, the Expert Group had begun to develop a road map for international coordination and information exchange regarding space weather events and the mitigation of its adverse impacts through risk analysis and assessment of user needs, as required under the objectives of thematic priority 
The Expert Group had highlighted two main goals through which the Committee could make significant and actionable future contributions to the mitigation of the adverse impacts of space weather: (a) Developing an improved basis for international monitoring, forecasting and warning procedures, especially in the form of more coordinated international communication and coordination of warnings of extreme space weather events. The Expert Group had noted that individual Member States had some existing capabilities in that regard upon which to build; (b) Defining a set of best practices, operating procedures and actions to mitigate the adverse impacts of extreme space weather, which required a prior assessment in each Member State of its exposure to risks from space weather and related socioeconomic impacts, as well as defined operating procedures, developed in partnership with administrations responsible for critical infrastructure and civil protection. 
The Expert Group had also continued to examine the potential future governance and cooperation mechanisms needed for the implementation of a 30/51 V.17-01120 A/AC.105/1138 comprehensive space weather mechanism. In that regard, the Expert Group had underlined that it was important that the Committee, through the Office for Outer Space Affairs, established a clear relationship between its role and that of other United Nations entities and other space weather stakeholders, including WMO, ICAO, the International Space Environment Service, the Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites, COSPAR, ISWI and SCOSTEP. 
The Expert Group had expressed appreciation to the Office for Outer Space Affairs for its support and for its presentations on the governance structures in place in the areas of global navigation satellite systems and the associated mechanism of ICG, and on planetary defence and the associated mechanisms of IAWN and SMPAG. IX. Near-Earth objects 
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 71/90, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee considered agenda item 11, “Near-Earth objects”. 
The representatives of China, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States, as well as the representative of Argentina, on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, made statements under agenda item 
Statements were also made by the observers for ASE, IAU, IAWN and SMPAG. During the general exchange of views, statements relating to the item were made by representatives of other member States. 
The Subcommittee heard the following scientific and technical presentations: (a) “Evolution of a (fictional) asteroid threat: preparing for planetary defence”, by the observer for IAA; (b) “Status report on the work of IAWN and SMPAG”, by the observers for IAWN and SMPAG; (c) “NEO-related activity in Indonesia: assessment of present and future projections”, by the representative of Indonesia; (d) “ESO’s role in ground-based observations of NEOs”, by the observer for ESO. 
The Subcommittee had before it a status report by IAWN and SMPAG, submitted by the Chairs of IAWN and SMPAG ( A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.25). 
The Subcommittee heard status reports by IAWN and SMPAG and noted with appreciation the efforts being made by IAWN and SMPAG to share information with regard to discovering, monitoring and physically characterizing potentially hazardous near-Earth objects in order to ensure that all nations, in particular developing countries with limited capacity to predict and mitigate an impact of a near-Earth object, were aware of potential threats. The Subcommittee also noted with appreciation their efforts to develop activities and build consensus on mitigating a potential near-Earth object threat, which, in the interest of public safety, required cooperative action by the global community. 
The Subcommittee noted that, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 71/90, the Office for Outer Space Affairs was to serve as the permanent secretariat of SMPAG. It was informed by SMPAG about the finalization of funding arrangements with the Office in that regard. 
The Subcommittee was informed about initial agreements by IAWN and SMPAG on the criteria and thresholds for impact response actions, which were contained in conference room paper A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.
The Subcommittee noted that SMPAG had held its eighth meeting on 1 February, on the margins of the current session of the Subcommittee, supported by V.17-01120 31/51 A/AC.105/1138 the Office for Outer Space Affairs, and was informed of the progress made in work under the SMPAG workplan, as contained in the report on that meeting, available at http://smpag.net. The Subcommittee was informed that the SMPAG Ad Hoc Working Group on Legal Issues, established by SMPAG in 2016, had held its first meeting on 2 February, on the margins of the current session of the Subcommittee, to discuss its terms of reference and to identify and agree on the scope of questions and plan of work, in particular with regard to addressing possible legal questions related to SMPAG workplan items. 
The Subcommittee noted that IAWN and the Office for Outer Space Affairs had initiated the establishment of an interface to facilitate general communication on near-Earth objects by the public, as well as for communication with Member States in the event of an impact warning. That was also linked to the UNISPACE+50 process, which was aimed at reinforcing some of the existing global coordination mechanisms in order to work towards strengthening the resiliency of societies and ensuring the long-term sustainability of outer space activities. 
The Subcommittee welcomed with appreciation the proclamation by the General Assembly in its resolution 71/90 of International Asteroid Day, which would be observed annually on 30 June, the anniversary of the 1908 Tunguska impact over Siberia, Russian Federation. International Asteroid Day was intended as a global awareness-raising campaign to provide the public with information about the possible asteroid impact hazard and about the crisis communication efforts at the global level in case of a credible near-Earth object threat; the work undertaken by SMPAG and IAWN, facilitated by the Office for Outer Space Affairs; and the work undertaken in that area by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its member States. 
The Subcommittee noted that nearly 19 million observations of asteroids had been collected in 2016 by the worldwide network of astronomical observatories in 76 countries. It also noted that the number of known near -Earth objects had exceeded 15,000 in October 2016 and currently totalled 15,688, of which 1,894 had been discovered in 2016, with 1,781 asteroids catalogued whose orbits took them within 8 million kilometres of Earth’s orbit. 
The Subcommittee also noted a number of national and regional networks and projects whose work contributed to IAWN efforts to enhance capabilities to observe near-Earth objects. They included the Asia-Pacific Asteroid Observation Network and the Deep Ecliptic Patrol of the Southern Sky (DEEP -South) project by the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute. 
The Subcommittee further noted a number of cooperative projects and asteroid observation missions, such as the JAXA sample return mission Hayabusa -2, scheduled to arrive at the target asteroid “Ryugu” in 2018, and the NASA sample return mission OSIRIS-Rex, launched in 2016 as an international mission with Canada, France and Japan and scheduled to arrive at the target asteroid “Bennu” in 2
The Subcommittee was informed of the progress of a number of international cooperative endeavours to pursue asteroid impact mitigation technology options, such as the European Union-funded NEOShield-2 project, coordinated by Airbus Defence and Space, Germany, with 11 partner organizations, the aim of which was to develop the demonstration mission concept to test the potential efficacy of the kinetic-impactor deflection method; and the double asteroid redirection test, which was part of the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission jointly undertaken by ESA and NASA. 
The Subcommittee noted a number of national activities and preparedness plans relating to near-Earth objects, including the National Near-Earth Objects Preparedness Strategy of the United States, issued on 30 December 2016 and prepared by the Interagency Working Group for Detecting and Mitigating the Impact 32/51 V.17-01120 A/AC.105/1138 of Earth-Bound Near-Earth Objects, which was co-chaired by NASA and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. 
The Subcommittee also noted that IAA would hold its fifth International Planetary Defence Conference in Tokyo from 15 to 19 May 2

The Subcommittee further noted that the next meetings of the IAWN steering committee and SMPAG would take place during the week beginning 9 October 2017, either in Europe or the United States, to review progress, current issues and future milestones. X. Use of nuclear power sources in outer space 
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 71/90, the Subcommittee considered agenda item 12, “Use of nuclear power sources in outer space”. 
The representatives of China, Indonesia, Mexico, Oman, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, the United States and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), as well as the representative of Argentina, on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, made statements under agenda item 
During the general exchange of views, statements relating to the item were also made by representatives of other member States. 
The Subcommittee heard a scientific and technical presentation entitled “Safety recommendations for nuclear power source applications in outer space ”, by the representative of the United Kingdom. 
The Subcommittee had before it the following: (a) Draft report on the implementation of the Safety Framework for Nuclear Power Source Applications in Outer Space and general recommendations for potential future work, prepared by the Working Group on the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space (A/AC.105/C.1/L.359); (b) Working paper submitted by the recommendations for nuclear power source (A/AC.105/C.1/L.360); United Kingdom on safety applications in outer space (c) A conference room paper submitted by France entitled “Proposal to revise the Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 47/68 of 14 December 1992 ” (A/AC.105/C.1/2016/CRP.7). 
The Subcommittee stressed the value and importance of implementing the voluntary Safety Framework for Nuclear Power Source Applications in Outer Space, which had been developed by the Subcommittee jointly with the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
Some delegations expressed the view that NPS should be used on board spacecraft only for deep space missions, or when their use was unavoidable. 
The Subcommittee noted that some States were developing, or considering developing, national legal and regulatory instruments on the safety of the use of NPS in outer space, taking into account the contents and requirements of the Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in O uter Space and of the Safety Framework. 
Some delegations expressed the view that the Safety Framework represented a significant advance in the development of safe NPS applications and that the implementation of the Safety Framework by Member States and int ernational V.17-01120 33/51 A/AC.105/1138 intergovernmental organizations would provide assurance to the global public that NPS applications for use in outer space were being developed, launched and used in a safe manner. 
The Subcommittee agreed that, in order to encourage the sharing o f best practices and substantiate national commitments to safety, it was important to continue to share, within the framework of the Working Group on the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space and under the present agenda item, experiences in implementing the guidance contained in the Safety Framework and in satisfying the intent of the Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space, and for Member States and intergovernmental organizations with experience with NPS missions to engage in discussions about advances in knowledge and practices and their potential for enhancing the technical content and scope of the Principles. 
Some delegations expressed the view that more consideration should be given to the use of NPS in terrestrial orbits in order to address the problem of potential collisions of objects with NPS on board and to the accidental re -entry of NPS into the Earth’s atmosphere. Those delegations were also of the view that more attention should be given to that matter through the formulation of adequate strategies, long-term planning, the issuance of regulations and the promotion of binding standards, as well as observance of the Safety Framework. 
Some delegations expressed the view that serious consideration should be given to the protection of the Earth’s biosphere from potential risks associated with the launch, operation and decommissioning of NPS applications. 
Some delegations expressed the view that, for more than five and a half decades, NPS applications had played a critical role in the exploration of space, enabling missions of scientific discovery to destinations across the solar system. 
The view was expressed that the use of NPS applications should be in conformity with international law, the Charter of the United Nations and United Nations treaties and principles on outer space, in particular the Outer Space Treaty. 
Some delegations expressed the view that, in order to ensure the safe use of NPS, it would be important for space actors with proven capabilities in that field to make available to other States their know-how and information on measures taken to ensure the safety of objects using NPS. 
Some delegations expressed the view that the regulatory process associated with the use of NPS in outer space was the exclusive responsibility of States, irrespective of their level of social, economic, scientific or technical development, and that the matter concerned all humanity. Those delegations were also of the view that Governments bore international responsibility for national activities involving the use of NPS in outer space conducted by governmental and non -governmental organizations alike, and that such activities must be beneficial, not detrimental, to humanity. 
The view was expressed that the effects of the use of NPS in outer space on humans and the environment had not been identified, that there still was no clearly defined regulatory framework for establishing the responsibilities of States with regard to the use of NPS and that potentially critical situatio ns arising from irresponsible practices in that area had not been addressed. The delegation expressing that view was also of the view that, in that connection, the Safety Framework in its current form was still insufficient. 
The view was expressed that, to date, the Working Group on the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space had not identified any challenges to implementing the Safety Framework that would require any modifications or additions to it. The delegation expressing that view was also of the view that, based on a practical assessment of and experience with the Safety Framework, the Framework provided a comprehensive and sufficient foundation for guidance for 34/51 V.17-01120 A/AC.105/1138 Member States and international intergovernmental space organizations to develop and operate their own NPS applications for use in outer space in a safe manner. 
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 71/90, the Subcommittee, at its 855th meeting, on 30 January, reconvened its Working Group on the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space under the chairmanship of Sam A. Harbison (United Kingdom). 
The Working Group on the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space held four meetings. At its 871st meeting, on 9 February, the Subcommittee endorsed the report and recommendations of the Working Group, including its new multi-year workplan (contained in annex II, paragraph 9, to the present report). XI. Long-term sustainability of outer space activities 
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 71/90, the Subcommittee considered agenda item 13, “Long-term sustainability of outer space activities”, under the workplan contained in the report of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space on its fifty-fourth session (A/66/20, annex II) and as extended by the Committee at its fifty-seventh and fifty-ninth sessions (A/69/20, para. 199 and A/71/20, para. 137). 
The representatives of Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Italy, Japan, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) made statements under agenda item 
A statement was made under the item by the representative of Argentina on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States. The observer for the Secure World Foundation also made a statement. During the general exchange of views, statements relating to the item were also made by representatives of other member States. 
The Subcommittee had before it the following: (a) Note by the Secretariat entitled “Guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities” (A/AC.105/C.1/L.354/Rev.1); (b) Working paper by the Chair of the Working Group on the Long -term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities entitled “Outline for the report of the Working Group on the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities” (A/AC.105/C.1/L.357); (c) Working paper submitted by the Russian Federation entitled “Further ideas on a set of goals for achieving the Vienna consensus on space sec urity and the need for thorough reflection on the modalities of addressing the complex issues associated with space traffic management and the justifiability of the high expectations of early decisions in the area” (A/AC.105/C.1/L.361); (d) Working paper by the Chair of the Working Group on the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities entitled “Proposals for the guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities” (A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.13); (e) Conference room paper submitted by the United Kingdom on the country’s implementation of the first set of guidelines for the long -term sustainability of outer space activities (A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.21); (f) Conference room paper submitted by France on French activities relating to and views on the long-term sustainability of outer space activities in relation to the implementation of the first set of guidelines (A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.26); (g) Working paper submitted by the Russian Federation entitled “Considerations aimed at facilitating a broader systemized understanding of the objective dimensions of issues and the functional dimensions of solutions related to V.17-01120 35/51 A/AC.105/1138 sharing information on the situation in outer space in the context of deciding on the establishment of a working group on enhanced information ex change on space objects and events” (A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.27); (h) Working paper by the Chair of the Working Group on the Long -term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities entitled “Guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities” (A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.29); (i) Working paper submitted by Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States containing a proposal for an expert group on space objects and events ( A/AC.105/L.302). 
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 71/90, the Working Group on the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities was reconvened under the chairmanship of Peter Martinez (South Africa). 
The Subcommittee welcomed the agreement reached at the fifty -ninth session of the Committee on a first set of guidelines on which negotiations had been carried out and concluded (A/71/20, para. 133) and recalled that the mandate of the Working Group had been extended for a further two years by the Committee (A/71/20, para. 137), with a view to developing a second set of guidelines that would be brought together with the preambular text and the first set of guidelines to form a full compendium of guidelines to be adopted by the Committee and referred to the General Assembly in 2018, to coincide with UNISPACE+50 (A/71/20, para. 133). 
The Subcommittee also welcomed the progress made by the Working Group on the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities since its most recent meeting, including the work undertaken during the fifty-ninth session of the Committee and during the third intersessional meeting of the Working Group, held in Vienna from 19 to 23 September 2
Some delegations expressed the view that the first set of guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities (A/71/20, annex), agreed to by the Committee at its fifty-ninth session, in June 2016, represented a milestone in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space. 
The view was expressed that the successful completion of a full compendium of guidelines would strengthen the role of the Committee as the anchor institution of the United Nations for space governance. 
The view was expressed that the Committee and its Subcommittees had a fundamental role in addressing the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, as that was a topic that demanded a multilateral approach and needed to be addressed at the international level. 
The view was expressed that it was imperative that the process to ensure the long-term sustainability of outer space activities within the Subcommittee succeeded in order to underscore and strengthen the role of the Committee as the leading multilateral forum for the progressive development and codification of space law and norms guiding the actions of States in outer space. 
The view was expressed that the Working Group should not lose sight of the international community’s common goal to develop a best practice compendium of broadly agreeable, non-binding guidelines to contribute to ensuring the sustainability of outer space activities for generations to come. 
Some delegations expressed the view that the completion of a final compendium of guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities would represent an important contribution to the UNISPACE+50 process. 
The view was expressed that those topics for which it might not be possible to complete specific guidelines by the fifty-fifth session of the Subcommittee could be considered further using the mechanisms specified under the relevant thematic priorities of UNISPACE+
In that context, the thematic priorities on the legal 36/51 V.17-01120 A/AC.105/1138 regime of outer space global space governance and on enhanced information exchange on space objects and events, the mechanisms of which included coordination with the Working Group, were specifically underscored. 
Some delegations expressed the view that it should be possible for the Working Group to reach a consensus on an additional number of guidelines during the current session of the Subcommittee. 
Some delegations expressed the view that the limited amount of time left to discuss the remaining draft guidelines was of concern, and that it was essential for the Working Group to adopt an efficient method of work whereby provisionally agreed draft guidelines would be set aside as they reached maturity and would not be re-examined until the adoption of the second set of guidelines. 
The view was expressed that work on the second set of guidelines should be conducted in a spirit of equality and in an open and tolerant manner, with all comments welcomed and all parties listened to. 
The view was expressed that the Working Group should encourage more countries, especially developing countries, to actively participate in its consultations and negotiations. 
Some delegations expressed the view that all delegations should embrace the “Vienna spirit” of negotiations and should contribute constructively to the ongoing efforts of the Working Group. 
Some delegations expressed the view that the decision by the Working Group to hold a fourth intersessional meeting in Vienna, just prior to the sixtieth session of the Committee, was a welcome one, and that they hoped that the same “Vienna spirit” of flexibility and cooperation that had characterized the third intersessional meeting of the Working Group, in 2016, would lead to substantial and demonstrable progress being made on the remaining draft guidelines. 
The view was expressed that the work on the guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities would only be completed once a complete version of all guidelines was available that took into account the interests of all States. The delegation expressing that view also stated that it reserved the right to comment on any guideline at any time. 
The view was expressed that the Working Group should formulate a detailed workplan to clarify the order in which the guidelines would be discussed at subsequent intersessional meetings and at the sixtieth session of the Committee, in June 2
The delegation expressing that view also stated that, once a decision was taken on the order in which the guidelines would be considered, the Working Group should strictly follow that order during consultations, so that all member States, especially those who were not native English speakers, could be better prepared for the discussions. 
The view was expressed that all guidelines for the long -term sustainability of outer space activities must align with current international law on outer space activities. 
The view was expressed that the guidelines were intended to compensate for the deficiencies of existing legal regulation through the voluntary, dedicated development of good and responsible practices that would include practices pertaining to registration, and that space safety and security trends were such that strengthening the legal regime and normative regulations for outer space activities was of paramount importance. The delegation expressing that vie w was also of the view that the guidelines should be standardized, bearing in mind existing space law and not the practice of non-participation in major multilateral space treaties. 
Some delegations expressed the view that the legal aspects of some of the topics under consideration by the Working Group should be discussed in the Legal Subcommittee. V.17-01120 37/51 A/AC.105/1138 
Some delegations expressed the view that outer space should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and that all legal means should be sought to preserve outer space for such purposes. Delegations expressing that view also stated that the lack of agreed definitions for the terms “arms” or “weapons” or the lack of progress in other specialized forums on non-militarization should not prevent the Committee from taking decisions reaffirming the use of outer space for exclusively peaceful purposes. 
The view was expressed that two new sections were needed in the guidelines document: one focusing on definitions and another focusing on principles. 
Some delegations expressed the view that the guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities should protect the interests of developing countries and emerging space nations and not limit their access to outer space. 
Some delegations expressed the view that the guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities should not become an instrument for countries that had traditionally managed space technology to impose restrictions on other countries. The delegations expressing that view also stated that it was the right of each State to develop and use space technology as a fundamental tool to improve the living conditions of its inhabitants. 
The view was expressed that special importance should be given to the technical aspects of ensuring the long-term sustainability of space activities, and that emphasis should be placed on international cooperation and the transfer of technology as effective means to promote research programmes and build capacity in countries with emerging space capabilities. 
Some delegations expressed the view that States should begin to focus their attention on implementing the guidelines. 
The view was expressed that it might be useful to agree that each member State would submit a report on the status of its implementation of the guidelines, taking into consideration that the guidelines were not legally binding and that their implementation was voluntary. The delegation expressing that view also stressed the importance of gathering and sharing information, insights and exper iences, ensuring transparency and building mutual confidence in a constructive atmosphere. 
The view was expressed that the guidelines should be effective, practicable, concise and based on evidence and best practice. 
Some delegations expressed the view that issues related to the long-term sustainability of outer space activities should be considered in the light of the conclusions set out in the report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Transparency and Confidence-Building Measures in Outer Space Activities (contained in A/68/189). 
The view was expressed that some of the proposed guidelines could be considered as potential measures to build transparency and confidence, whereas others could provide the technical basis for the implementation of other measures to strengthen stability in outer space. 
The Subcommittee welcomed the side event on the theme “Long-term sustainability guidelines implementation: an open dialogue ”, organized by the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom, which had provided a valuable opportunity for member States to exchange views on their experiences and expectations on implementation of the guidelines, and noted the related conference room papers submitted by the United Kingdom and France on their experiences implementing the first set of guidelines (A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.21 and A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.26). 
At its 872nd meeting, on 9 February, the Subcommittee endorsed the report of the Working Group on the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities, which is contained in annex III to the present report. 38/51 V.17-01120 A/AC.105/1138 XII. Examination of the physical nature and technical attributes of the geostationary orbit and its utilization and applications, including in the field of space communications, as well as other questions relating to developments in space communications, taking particular account of the needs and interests of developing countries, without prejudice to the role of the International Telecommunication Union 
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 71/90, the Subcommittee considered agenda item 14, “Examination of the physical nature and technical attributes of the geostationary orbit and its utilization and applications, including in the field of space communications, as well as other questions relating to developments in space communications, taking particular account of the needs and interests of developing countries, without prejudice to the role of the International Telecommunication Union”, as a single issue/item for discussion. 
The representatives of Indonesia, Oman, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, South Africa and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), as well as the representative of Argentina, on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, made statements under agenda item 
During the general exchange of views, statements relating to the item were made by representatives of member States and by the observer for ITU. 
The Subcommittee heard the following scientific and technical presentations: (a) “Pioneering last-mile logistics in space”, by the representative of Israel; (b) “Report of the International Telecommunication Union on the use of the geostationary satellite orbit and other orbits”, by the observer for ITU. 
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the information provided in the annual report for 2016 of the Radiocommunication Bureau of ITU on the use of the geostationary satellite orbit and other orbits (see www.itu.int/ITU-R/space/snl/report/), as well as other documents referred to in conference room paper A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.
The Subcommittee invited ITU to continue to submit reports to it. 
Some delegations expressed the view that the geostationary orbit was a limited natural resource that was at risk of becoming saturated, thereby threatening the sustainability of space activities in that environment; that its exploitation should be rationalized; and that it should be made available to all States, under equitable conditions, irrespective of their current technical capabilities, taking into particular account the needs of developing countries and the geographical position of certain countries. Those delegations were also of the view that it was important to use the geostationary orbit in compliance with international law, in accordance with the decisions of ITU and within the legal framework established in the relevant United Nations treaties. 
Some delegations expressed the view that the geostationary orbit, as a limited natural resource clearly in danger of saturation, must be used rationally, efficiently, economically and equitably. That principle was deemed fundamental to safeguarding the interests of developing countries and countries with a certain geographical position, as set out in article 44, paragraph 196.2, of the Constitution of ITU, as amended by the Plenipotentiary Conference held in Minneapolis, United States, in 1
Some delegations expressed the view that the geostationary orbit provided unique potential for access to communications and information, in particular for assisting developing countries in implementing social programmes and educational projects, disseminating knowledge and providing medical assistance. V.17-01120 39/51 A/AC.105/1138 
Some delegations expressed the view that the utilization by States of the geostationary orbit on the basis of “first come, first served” was unacceptable and that the Subcommittee, with the involvement of ITU, should therefore develop a regime guaranteeing equitable access to orbital positions for States. 
The view was expressed that the current regime for the exploitation and utilization of the geostationary orbit provided opportunities mostly to the countries with greater financial and technical capabilities and, in that connection, there was a need to take anticipatory measures to address the potential dominance of such countries in the utilization of space in order to address the needs of developing countries and of countries in particular geographical areas, such as those in equatorial regions. 
Some delegations expressed the view that the current system of reserving slots in the geostationary orbit was abused by a number of satellite operators, which obtained dozens or even hundreds of orbital positions for the purpose of reselling them at more expensive prices, thereby hindering the development of the space programmes of those willing to utilize that unique orbit diligently. The delegations expressing that view were also of the view that the distribution of those critical locations should be made fairly, in accordance with the principle of equality and taking into account the limited character of the orbit, and that each State should have at least two orbital slots reserved in the location near its national territory. 
The view was expressed that the exchange of information on the use of the geostationary orbit could be an effective measure serving the needs of States with regard to its efficient use. The delegation expressing that view was also of the view that the first steps towards such information exchange could be the establishment of communication between the Subcommittee and ITU -R study group 4, and the inclusion of an item on increasing the efficiency and exc hange of information regarding the use of orbital and frequency resources of the geostationary orbit in the agenda of the World Radiocommunication Conference 2
Some delegations expressed the view that, in order to ensure the sustainability of the geostationary orbit, as well as to assure guaranteed and equitable access to the geostationary orbit based on the needs of all nations, taking into particular account the needs and interests of developing countries, it was necessary to keep that issue on the agenda of the Subcommittee and to explore it further, through the creation of appropriate working groups and legal and technical intergovernmental panels, as necessary. XIII. Draft provisional agenda for the fifty-fifth session of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee 
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 71/90, the Subcommittee considered agenda item 15, “Draft provisional agenda for the fifty-fifth session of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee”. 
The Subcommittee noted that the Secretariat had scheduled the fifty-fifth session of the Subcommittee to be held from 29 January to 9 February 2
The Subcommittee also noted that, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 71/90, it would submit to the Committee its proposal on t he draft provisional agenda for the fifty-fifth session of the Subcommittee and recommended that the following items be included in the draft provisional agenda: 40/51

(Single issue/item for discussion) 
Draft provisional agenda for the fifty-sixth session of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee. 
Report to the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. 
The Subcommittee agreed that the topic for the symposium to be organized in 2018 by the Office for Outer Space Affairs should be “Expanding horizons: the case for industry engagement in UNISPACE+50 and beyond”. 
The Subcommittee took note of the proposal made by ICG (A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.18) and agreed that, under the agenda item on recent developments in global navigation satellite systems, a general exchange of information should be included on issues related to GNSS spectrum protection and interference detection and mitigation, with a view to raising awareness of efforts to achieve the overall goal of promoting effective use of GNSS open service s by the global community. In that context, the Subcommittee encouraged States members and permanent observers of the Committee to participate in the focused exchange of information under the item. 
The Subcommittee noted that the Action Team on Space Exploration and Innovation had held two meetings on the margins of the present session of the Subcommittee under the co-chairmanship of China, Jordan and the United States, with a view to preparing its terms of reference and finalizing its report for UNISPACE+50, in 2
The Subcommittee encouraged States members and permanent observers of the Committee to nominate focal points for the Action Team. 
The Subcommittee recalled the agreement reached at its fifty-second session, in 2015 (A/AC.105/1088, para. 275), and considered that it was necessary to add V.17-01120 41/51 A/AC.105/1138 further measures related to the management of scientific and technical presentations. The Subcommittee therefore decided that: (a) States m embers and observers of the Committee should communicate to the Secretariat no later than one week before each session of the Subcommittee their wish to make scientific and technical presentations; and (b) the Secretariat would take the necessary decisions in the scheduling of presentations in the interest of the smooth running of the sessions. 42/51 V.17-01120 A/AC.105/1138 Annex I Report of the Working Group of the Whole 
In accordance with paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 71/90, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, at its fifty-fourth session, reconvened its Working Group of the Whole. 
From 2 to 10 February 2017, the Working Group held five meetings, under the chairmanship of Mylswami Annadurai (India). The Working Group considered the following items: (a) Preparations for UNISPACE+50; (b) Space technology for sustainable socioeconomic development; (c) Draft provisional agenda for the fifty-fifth session of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee. 
The Working Group had before it the documents listed in paragraph 68 of the report of the Subcommittee on its fifty-fourth session. 
At its 5th meeting, on 10 February, the Working Group adopted the present report. I. Preparations for UNISPACE+50 
At the 1st meeting of the Working Group, the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the Secretariat informed the Working Group of the status of preparations for UNISPACE+50, in 2
With reference to a number of documents submitted to the Subcommittee at its fifty-fourth session, she gave a strategic overview of the preparations for UNISPACE+50, including actions taken and activities being prepared under the UNISPACE+50 thematic priorities, as defined by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space at its fifty -ninth session (A/71/20, para. 296). 
The Director, in her statement, underlined the importance of adhering to organizational, administrative and reporting timelines for substantive activities that generated recommendations for UNISPACE+
She said that the Office was dedicated to working with member States and all relevant stakeholders towards UNISPACE+50 and beyond in order to build a foundation for a comprehensive “Space2030” agenda that would help define the role of space activities in both addressing overarching long-term development concerns and contributing to global efforts towards achieving the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. For that reason, the Office required support, both financial and in kind, from member States and organizations. 
The Working Group welcomed the progress made in the overall preparations under the UNISPACE+50 thematic priorities. The Working Group commended the Office for the achievements made to date in the preparations for UNISPACE+ 50 and for the activities planned. 
The Working Group reiterated that UNISPACE+50 presented a unique opportunity to position space as a driver for socioeconomic sustainable development and to strengthen the role of the Committee, its subsidiary bodies and t he Office for Outer Space Affairs as the centre of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space and the governance of outer space activities. 
The Working Group noted with satisfaction that the newly established Action Team on Space Exploration and Innovation, under the thematic priority on global partnership in space exploration and innovation, had held meetings on the margins of the current session of the Subcommittee, under the co -chairmanship of China, V.17-01120 43/51 A/AC.105/1138 Jordan and the United States of America, and that it had advanced its work by developing its terms of reference. 
The Working Group also noted with satisfaction the progress made under other thematic priorities during the current session of the Subcommittee, as reported in the report of the Subcommittee on its fifty-fourth session, in particular on the thematic priorities entitled “International framework for space weather services” and “Strengthened space cooperation for global health”. The work on those thematic priorities had been undertaken by the Expert Group on Space Weather, chaired by Canada, and the Expert Group on Space and Global Health, co -chaired by Canada and Switzerland. The work of the expert groups was substantively supported by the Office for Outer Space Affairs. 
The Working Group noted with appreciation that, as part of the preparations for UNISPACE+50 and with the aim of advancing the debate on the role of space science and technology in fostering global development, a high -level forum on space as a driver for socioeconomic sustainable development had been held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from 20 to 24 November 2016, organized by the Office for Outer Space Affairs in collaboration with the Government of the United Arab Emirates. 
The Working Group also noted with appreciation that the 2017 high-level forum, under the leadership of the Office for Outer Space Affairs, would also be held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from 6 to 9 November 2
That forum would focus on building stronger partnerships among space actors. It w as noted that Germany had offered to host and co-organize the 2018 forum, to be held in the second half of that year in Bonn. That forum would focus on the implementation of UNISPACE+50 deliverables and outcomes towards a Space2030 agenda and would be co-sponsored by the European Space Agency. 
The Working Group acknowledged the need for the Office to be able to build stronger partnerships with Governments, international intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and non-governmental entities, in order to provide enhanced support to developing countries and to further the objectives of the UNISPACE+50 process. It requested the Office to apprise the Committee at its sixtieth session, in 2017, on developments in that regard, including by submitting a revised version of A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.
The Working Group considered the preparations under thematic priority 3, on enhanced information exchange on space objects and events, taking into account the work of the Working Group on the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities. 
The Working Group noted several issues to be taken into account in order to decide upon an adequate way forward under that thematic priority. Those issues included: (a) the need to further assess the most appropriate mechanism, such as a possible new working group or expert group under the current agenda item of the Subcommittee on the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, or a new agenda item; (b) the composition of the dedicated chairmanship of such a mechanism; and (c) the period of a corresponding multi-year workplan, possibly starting from 2019, pending further consideration of the r elationship between the objective and the planned outcome of the thematic priority and the current work of the Working Group on the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities. Related proposals submitted or to be submitted by States members of the Committee would form the basis for further work. 
The Working Group recommended that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space further consider those issues referred to in paragraph 15 above, and others that might arise, during its sixtieth session, in June 2017, with a view to making progress towards establishing a dedicated mechanism under that thematic priority. 44/51 V.17-01120 A/AC.105/1138 
The Working Group noted that, in order to achieve timely progress under all thematic priorities, the Committee, at its sixtieth session, should consider the overall status of preparations and evaluate the need for further measures and actions to successfully meet the objectives of the UNISPACE+50 process. 
The Working Group exchanged views relating to the “Dark and quiet skies” proposal for protecting the environmental observing conditions for large astronomical observatories and world citizens, submitted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) (A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.17). 
Some delegations underlined the importance of the matter and called for the minimizing of light pollution. 
The Working Group agreed that the Office for Outer Space Affairs should submit the proposal to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), with a view to obtaining an official reply from UNESCO on the matter. 
The Working Group encouraged IAU to attend the sixtieth session of the Committee, in June 2017, at which further consideration should be given to the proposal. II. Space technology for sustainable socioeconomic development 
The Working Group noted that the Expert Group on Space and Global Health had held its third meeting on 2 and 3 February 2017, on the margins of the current session of the Subcommittee. The meeting had been held under the co-chairmanship of Canada and Switzerland and the aim of the meeting had been to advance the Expert Group’s work under items 2 and 3 of the workplan presented at the fifty-second session of the Subcommittee (A/AC.105/1088, annex I, para. 7 (b)) and to discuss the involvement of the Expert Group in preparations for UNISPACE+50 thematic priority 5, on strengthened space cooperation for global health. 
The Working Group also noted that the Expert Group had reviewed and discussed various key activities held during the previous year that were relevant to the application of space science and technology to global health. The Expert Group had also discussed ways to further strengthen interagency cooperation, both domestically and internationally, between space and health organizations and ways to increase awareness of the benefits that space technologies could offer the global health community. 
The Working Group took note of the roadmap developed by the Expert Group (see A/AC.105/C.1/2017/CRP.28) in order to set out the next steps in developing the appropriate components underpinning the thematic priority on strengthened space cooperation for global health. It noted that, as part of that roadmap, the Expert Group had agreed to support the preparations for a conference on space and global health to be organized jointly by the Office for Outer Space Affairs and the World Health Organization. The conference would be sponsored by the Government of Switzerland, and possibly co-sponsored by other relevant organizations and stakeholders. The conference would be held in Geneva in 2
III. Draft provisional agenda for the fifty-fifth session of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee 
The Working Group noted that, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 71/90, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee would submit to the Committee its proposal for the draft provisional agenda for the fifty -fifth session of the Subcommittee, to be held in 2
V.17-01120 45/51 A/AC.105/1138 
The Working Group agreed that the topic for the 2018 symposium to be organized by the Office for Outer Space Affairs, in accordance with the agreement reached by the Subcommittee at its forty-fourth session, in 2007 (A/AC.105/890, annex I, para. 24), should be “Expanding horizons: the case for industry engagement in UNISPACE+50 and beyond”. 
The Working Group exchanged views on the logistical challenges posed by a high number of technical presentations being given, keeping in mind that it demonstrated a high level of interest among experts, and recommended that the issue of scheduling technical presentations and any other organizational matters, as well as the draft provisional agenda of the Subco mmittee, be considered by the Subcommittee, under its agenda item 
/51 V.17-01120 A/AC.105/1138 Annex II Report of the Working Group on the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space 
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 71/90, the Subcommittee, at its 855th meeting, on 30 January, reconvened its Working Group on the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space under the chairmanship of Sam A. Harbison (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). 
The Working Group recalled the objectives of its multi-year workplan for the period 2010-2015, adopted by the Subcommittee at its forty-seventh session, in 2010 (A/AC.105/958, annex II, para. 8) and extended to 2017 by the Subcommittee at its fifty-first session, in 2014 (A/AC.105/1065, annex II, para. 9): (a) To promote and facilitate the implementation of the Safety Framework for Nuclear Power Source Applications in Outer Space by providing information pertinent to challenges faced by member States and international intergovernmental organizations, in particular those considering or initiating involvement in applications of nuclear power sources (NPS) in outer space; (b) To identify any technical topics for, and establish the objectives, scope and attributes of, any potential additional work by the Working Group to further enhance safety in the development and use of space NPS applications. Any such additional work would require the approval of the Subcommittee and would be developed with due consideration for relevant principles and treaties.
